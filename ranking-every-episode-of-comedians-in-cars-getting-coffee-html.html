Thus Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee — a series that lets Seinfeld take his friends on drives in slick cars to get some joe and grub — was born. For viewers, the lack of fanfare and production makes us voyeurs to the lives of comedians. The <a href=#>best episodes</a> are the ones that really make you feel like you’re eavesdropping on a private moment between friends.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgz3tvwt0m2byzmcut2kh1dj@published data-word-count=24>Now that the series is all on Netflix with a brand-new season, let’s see which episodes top the charts and which ones fall flat:</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjibzetw600183b60g21fup9z@published>82.

The conversation forays into where different comics take their career. It always feels a little awkward when Seinfeld and his guests’ accomplishments don’t match up. Also, the banter, which is the real meat of the show, just seems flat and lackluster. Not comparable to the others at all. This episode was like watching pastel paint dry from a really uncomfortable wicker chair. However, it deserves credit for taking the time to deconstruct the term “douchebag.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgz3tvwt0m2eyzmc52sw5tks@published data-word-count=8><strong>Best Line: </strong>“That guy’s a real ottoman.” —Martin</p><span class=divider-border></span><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjibzfr9e001z3b60kqkmn66d@published>81.

Is that too harsh? Seinfeld takes Miranda Sings to the diner, where she schools him on “WeHo” — or West Hollywood as it’s more popularly known — and the “porn men.” If you are a fan of Miranda Sings then you will probably adore this episode, but I am not a fan, so to me this episode is like the puffy shirt all over again, except the puffy shirt is Miranda Sings. Yes, here is my transparent bias.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgz3tvwt0m2hyzmchqh49te8@published data-word-count=14><strong>Best Line:</strong> “You live in [West Hollywood]?

I think there’s something that happens when the older generation of comedians gets together with the up-and-comers: awkwardness.

Nothing in this episode can top that, not even the beard trim Seinfeld has planned for Joyner. Half of this series just feels like Seinfeld getting off on finding weird, and yet somehow very mundane, situations to slide his guests into. But I’m fine with that.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjya5r9pk02oh3h65i8e5ibo0@published data-word-count=10><strong>Best Line:</strong> All the Glengarry Glen Ross lines (you’ll see).</p><span class=divider-border></span><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjibzg9ex002l3b608p0z44p2@published>78.

Or as Seinfeld dubs this episode, “Comedians in Cars Getting Aggravated.” Parker is not a comedian, so I am right there with the aggravation. There’s a lot of nostalgia talk in this episode, except it’s not about comedy but about life back in the day when parents drove station wagons. A good chunk of this episode is also spent arguing over how much to tip, just to remind us all that celebrities are </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>not </span></i><span style=font-weight:400>like us.

It’s a hard one to crack. The conversation leans heavily on Stern’s insecurities and things he has been trying to work out, and in the process he tries to sell Seinfeld on therapy. There’s also a very uncomfortable moment where Stern forgets he’s not in his studio and tries to get Seinfeld to go negative. This episode gave me agita.</span></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgz3tvwt0m2nyzmcaxfw23u6@published data-word-count=20><strong>Best Line:</strong> “I feel like this is the most unimportant show in show business that I’m on right now.” —Stern</p><span class=divider-border></span><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjya7gd6y03nl3h651ujxobkd@published>76.

Amid quite a few awkward pauses, the two comics talk New York real estate, film, and Barry’s favorite citrus joke that never gets any laughs. I love Barry. However, that kind of odd, shy persona works very well for Barry onstage, but it sets a very slow pace for the episode.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgz3tvwt0m2qyzmc1vqb00vu@published data-word-count=18><strong>Best Line: </strong>“What about all those shirts in Macy’s?

There’s a little wife talk, a little children talk, a little comedian talk. Plus Gaffigan leads a game of “21 Questions.” This episode has my personal favorite vehicle of the bunch, but the rest of it is kind of a yawn.

Expensive German machinery aside, turns out, Murphy and Seinfeld started at the Comic Strip in Manhattan the exact same week, but despite knowing each other for decades, they have not run out of compliments for one another. The majority of this episode is them fanboying over each other, which I guess is kind of cute. This episode is also the start of some awkward moments of reminiscing about their respective relationships with Bill Cosby. While Cosby’s recent headlines don’t make the cut, Murphy does admit that Cosby wasn’t very nice to him — compared to the rest of the comics he interacted with. Why? We may never know, but that seal of approval is, I would assume, not something Murphy is pining for these days. While it’s nice to see two legends hang out, this episode left something to be desired, and I found myself constantly checking the progress bar for an ETA for the ending.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjya597l0006x3h65zhnq64hp@published data-word-count=12><strong>Best Line: </strong>“Planet of the Apes is the Wizard of Oz.”&nbsp; —Murphy</p><span class=divider-border></span><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjibzn9u2007a3b60c112h4v1@published>71.

The Saturday Night Live alum dives into how her persona made her uniquely apt for her improv and SNL. Wiig is such a sunny presence and so funny when onstage, but this episode was a little sleepy. She did talk about how she is more comfortable in character than she is talking to people, so maybe that can account for it. If you are a fan of Wiig and familiar with her work, then it’s almost like watching two completely different people.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgz3tvwt0m37yzmczihe6o27@published data-word-count=19><strong>Best Line:</strong> “I love two people getting heated up and jumping into bed because of an old Volvo.” —Seinfeld</p><span class=divider-border></span><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjibzp2b000as3b60rap2k6qy@published>68.

This episode gets into it, but maybe not in the way you want. Gervais, who we haven’t seen since the first season, makes a triumphant return in a two-parter that asks the question, “Do we leave the China joke in or not?” The heft of this episode focuses on a joke in which Gervais says he loves New York because no two people are the same and Seinfeld asks “Where are people all the same?” Then follows up with, you might have already guessed, “China maybe?” Now obviously that’s a pretty cheap line and joke that many would take offense to, so Gervais and Seinfeld spend the rest of the episodes discussing whether the joke should remain or be edited out. Both lean on the fact that obviously they know it’s offensive but Seinfeld used it (and Gervais thought to say it) because it pokes fun at a ridiculous stereotype that they for sure don’t believe in at all. For sure. Not only does the joke stay in, but it’s the title of both part one and two. Take that as you will.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjya5dasv00wb3h65ol69xuv6@published data-word-count=11><strong>Best Line:</strong> “No one’s interested in a show about nothing.” —Seinfeld</p><span class=divider-border></span><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjya5blk200jk3h65cf0y765t@published>65.

What is it good for? Nothing.” That’s how Seinfeld describes the 1976 Dodge Royal Monaco sedan he’s picked out for his guest, Seth Rogen. “I like things that exist,” says Seinfeld, “just because they want to exist.” Which, in his mind, is why it’s perfect for Rogen, who lacks the appearance of a movie star but somehow “is one.” So off to a good start! The comics head over to Canter’s Deli to split some fries and chat about the night they both ran into Cosby after an awards show where Cosby took home a lifetime achievement award that Seinfeld first declined. The Cosby chat is quickly followed by awkward silence because really, what is there to say? So with the important, generationally relevant conversation behind them, they head to Arby’s seemingly just to get the employees to say, “We have the meats.” Look out because I’m about to pitch Comedians in Cars Getting Fast Food.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjya5b9a700hg3h65bulmxtgw@published data-word-count=11><strong>Best Line: </strong>“Do you want to split some French fries?” —Rogen</p><span class=divider-border></span><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjic0kv0t02k33b60wqyfmoxy@published>64.

There’s a lot that doesn’t get censored in this series, but in this episode Everett says a name that they black-box and bleep out, but it propels Seinfeld into a anger-fueled rant about how much he hates the guy who “is not funny” and “had to do that stupid fucking voice because [he] had no fucking act.” For Seinfeld, who is a vet of “clean comedy” and barely cusses, this was a moment. To be honest, I spent the rest of the episode trying to figure out who they were talking about.

But before the duo puts the car into first gear (is that how those things work?) and take off for Citi Field, they have to get some coffee and outerwear. This is where one of the best things I’ve seen in all these 80-plus episodes happens: Looking to stock up on some winter essentials at Patagonia, Broderick and Seinfeld don’t even make it past the double doors before a store employee blocks them from coming in, citing that he’d lose his job. Why that would be the outcome is never explained. You’d think the one thing that’s not bad for business is having two megastars peruse your outerwear. Thankfully, though, Seinfeld has the mind to try again after their first cup of coffee, and this time they are welcomed to Patagonia with open arms. Finally they make it to Citi Field where they suit up in their personalized Mets uniforms and take the mound after a quick workout of Brodeick pushing Seinfeld around the gym in a rolly chair.

And okay, there is also a little bias on my part from his Beetlejuice days.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgz3tvwu0m7gyzmcuzba6z19@published data-word-count=15><strong>Best Line: </strong>“Your life has been one unbroken boulevard of green lights, hasn’t it?” —Baldwin</p><span class=divider-border></span><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjic15hi804zy3b60aiq9pj95@published>1. Garry Shandling: “It’s Great That Garry Shandling Is Still Alive” (Season 7, Episode 4)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/7fd/231/7b4b1332a1724f4a569e41a94ae0d4934a-17-comedians-fey.w710.jpg><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgz3tvwu0m7iyzmc0h29x7yu@published data-word-count=73><span style=font-weight:400>This episode aired just a couple of months before Shandling passed away, and it’s just so sad to watch now, especially with that title. Like it jinxed it. Seinfeld and Shandling go on a walk down memory lane and spend a good chunk of time reminiscing in the famous Comedy Store. Shandling is so effervescent and full of life, just a treasure that went too soon. Keep the tissues close with this one.</span></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgz3tvwu0m7jyzmcejtzg2jl@published data-word-count=9><strong>Best Line:</strong> Shandling and Seinfeld’s Matthew McConaughey Lincoln commercial.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgz3tvwu0m7kyzmcr0tyjiim@published data-word-count=21>Daniella Bondar is a writer and NYC dweller.
