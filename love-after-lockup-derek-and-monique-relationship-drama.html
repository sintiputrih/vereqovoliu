Though many viewers wonder <a href=#>how Love After Lockup couples meet</a>, with this duo, it was quite simple. One night while Monique was on Facebook, she stumbled into a group for inmates looking to become pen pals.</p><p>After finally meeting Derek in person after nearly two years, Monique was able to put her trust worries to rest, especially with insecurities surrounding her weight. Derek was all she had hoped for and more. But suddenly everything went downhill.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>'Love After Lockup': Here's How Sarah Simmons Got In Shape</a></span></p><p>Monique and Derek's relationship is one of the most stormy in the series, with Monique going to extreme measures to ensure that Derek wasn't cheating on her, including setting up hidden cameras, and Monique even bailing Derek out of jail.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=monique-installed-cameras-to-make-sure-derek-wasn-rsquo-t-cheating-on-her>Monique Installed Cameras To Make Sure Derek Wasn’t Cheating On Her</h2><p>Not long after Derek's release, they were being followed by a strange car. Although Derek claimed he didn't recognize the driver, he has the same suspicion as Monique that it was an ex-lover. With his freedom restored, Derek maybe hoped to reconnect with a former lover.</p><p>Given his fearless personality, it baffles Monique that he would ever bring a date back to his grandmother's place. Given the level of distrust between them, their prospects for a happy future together are dim.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/1-3.png><p>Derek and Monique go to see his grandmother. While Monique is in Chicago, Derek will be sleeping alone in his room, so she looks for places to hide security cameras.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The ultimate goal was for her to return to Cleveland with all of her belongings and settle in with him permanently. It almost seemed like the <a href=#>Love After Lockup couple would beat the odds</a>, but she has doubts that her partner will be responsible in her absence.</p><p>“I’d like to see if I can locate suitable places to put the cameras so I can keep an eye on him when I’m at home in Chicago,” Monique tells producers.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/love-after-lockup-derek-and-monique.png><p>The video then cuts to Derek telling a member of his family that Monique has been "strong" all through their relationship, even while he was in jail.</p><p>He had no notion that his relationship with her may be shakier than he thinks it is.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=derek-did-cheat-on-monique-confirming-her-suspicions>Derek Did Cheat On Monique, Confirming Her Suspicions</h2><p>It turns out that Monique was right to be wary about Derek's commitment as a partner. Monique finally comes clean about catching Derek cheating on her after his release from jail.</p><p>Because of this, she broke up with him or made attempts to, but Derek is making every effort to get her back. There's no denying that Derek messed up, but he's making amends and trying his best to win Monique back.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/4-3.png><p>“I was unfaithful to Monique because our relationship was in a gray area. I didn’t feel like it was a relationship. I was wrong for that. I shouldn’t be cheating. I shouldn’t be stepping out.” Derek informs the cameras during a confessional.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“Since Monique been back in Chicago, we’ve been talking every day, texting, laughing like we almost like we back to that good place where I was going to propose,” Derek mentioned to the producer.</p><p>Having spent some time in Chicago, Monique has returned to her home state of Ohio. She and her sisters are in the car discussing Derek's infidelity. She hasn't seen Derek in over a month, Monique tells her siblings, but she's eager to find out the truth about a lot of things.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/3-3.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Her siblings worry that she won't be able to put the past behind her and start over. Monique claims that Derek has expressed a desire to repair their relationship by requesting her return to Ohio. After learning that Derek had been cheating on her, Monique is thinking about trying to make amends with him.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>'Love After Lockup': The Reason Glorietta And Alexander Split</a></span></p><p>Because of Derek's past of drug usage and dealing and the reappearance of his ex-girlfriends, Monique has had serious trust issues since his release from prison. And to be fair, she might be right.</p><h2 id=monique-and-derek-were-fired-by-love-after-lockup-and-derek-was-arrested-again>Monique And Derek Were Fired By Love After Lockup And Derek Was Arrested Again</h2><p>Since they first appeared on the show, Monique and Derek's relationship has been plagued by continual controversy. It seems like drama has always been the norm for them, whether it be amongst themselves or with Derek's sisters Elizabeth and Aubryanna.</p><p>The latest show announcement has rocked the Love After Lockup fandom to its core. Insiders say that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Derek and Monique were fired off the show</a> because they complained that the network hadn't done enough to stop a fight between Monique's family and Derek's sisters.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/5-2.png><p>According to the news, Monique Robinson and her siblings got into a fight with Derek Warner's sisters. Elizabeth, Derek's transgender sister, spoke on Instagram Live to confirm the couple's termination from the network.</p><p>Due to their continual bickering, Derek and Monique are no longer filming for the show and will not be featured in the upcoming season, as Elizabeth explains in the video.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Love After Lockup: Where Are They Now?</a></span></p><p>Love After Lockup viewers are probably asking what went down and why Derek and Monique were let go as a result of this news. Since neither the show's creators nor the pair themselves have commented on the rumors, everything is conjecture at this time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Some viewers speculated that the couple's behavior on the show contributed to their dismissal because they were too divisive. Others speculate that they left the show due to legal concerns that occurred during filming.</p><p>The situation has escalated a notch because <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Derek has been detained once again</a>. Their relationship has been fraught with difficulties since he began dating Monique. Nonetheless, he appeared to be keeping himself out of jail time. That, alas, appears to be a thing of the past.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/6-1.png><p>The couple continues on, but Derek has circled back to the beginning. On March 28, 2023, while he was exiting a restaurant, police stopped Derek and charged him with felonious assault. In addition, Monique appears to have been present, though she was waiting for her boyfriend in a car.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although it is common knowledge that Monique enjoyed lavishing money on Derek, he did not spend too much time behind bars because he was able to post the $10,000 bond. So, it's possible that she was the one who paid the bail. Besides, <a href=#>Love After Lockup couples are making bank</a> by being on the show, so she likely had funds to spare for her boo.</p><p>Fans of reality television can rest assured that Love After Lockup will continue to deliver on the drama and intrigue front. Derek and Monique's whirlwind voyage on the show will be remembered for many seasons despite their departure.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGijqK6VYq6nwMSrZKWnk6DCsXnDnqmeo12Wu6V5zKiloqmlmnqzscuaq6Knnqi1qryMnamapZFk</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./scott-eby-who-kidnapped-a-3-year-old-illinois-girl-raped-her-and-then-drowned-her-in-a-creek-dies-while-in-prison-leading-an-attorney-to-declare-finally-justice-for-riley.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Scott Eby who kidnapped a 3-year-old Illinois girl, raped her and then drowned her in a creek dies w">&larr;
