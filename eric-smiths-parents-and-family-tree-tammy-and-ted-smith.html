In 1994, a jury convicted Eric Smith guilty of second-degree murder. He received a nine-year to life jail term. According to reports, his punishment was the highest penalty at the time for killing a minor.</strong></p><p>In October 2021, the killer of Derrick Robie received parole. Eric Smith was released from Sullivan County’s Woodburne Correctional Facility in February 2022 after serving over 30 years in jail. His release has received a lot of media coverage.</p><h2>Eric Smith’s parents and family tree: Tammy and Ted Smith</h2><p>The parents of Eric Smith, Tammy Smith, and Ted Smith, welcomed him into the world on January 22, 1980. He will be 43 years old in 2023. When the Smiths learned that their son had slain an innocent youngster, they must have been horrified. According to reports, the judgment crushed Tammy and Ted. However, they persuaded themselves to believe that their son had a serious illness and would get the worst jail term possible.</p><p>When asked to describe what he observed on the day of Derrick Robie’s murder, Eric Smith’s grandpa remembered his grandson stating, “I am sorry, Mom, I killed that boy.” Ted Smith, however, said that his son was emotionless and unremorseful during the trial. Eric’s father remarked, “I don’t remember him ever stating he was sorry for murdering the youngster.</p><p>Eric initially entered a not-guilty plea to the allegation of second-degree murder. But ultimately, he admitted to murdering the little youngster. There aren’t many specifics on Eric’s parent’s occupations. Additionally, it is unknown where they are from and where they are right now.</p><h2>What Motivated Eric Smith to Kill Derric Robie?</h2><p>The key question remained unanswered at the trial’s end. Smith never gave a reason for why he did what he did. However, the convicted killer explained ten years later.</p><p>He said he wanted to vent his rage on someone. Robie, regrettably, was the unfortunate victim. A year after murdering Derrick Robie, Eric Smith testified in front of a jury in front of the whole country’s press media.</p><p>According to Smith’s defense attorney, Smith “had a mental disease that can be classified as a rage disorder” and was not liable for the murder because of this. Smith had speech problems and a history of outbursts as a kid, according to trial evidence. Additionally, the jury was made aware of Eric’s ongoing bullying and expulsion from school.</p><p>Experts on both sides conducted a thorough medical examination of Smith. Hormone levels and brain activity were examined, but neither indicator could explain his violent conduct. The prosecution also refuted the idea that Smith was insane, asserting that he was fully responsible for his conduct under the law and aware that they were wrong.</p><p>Eric often shared his experiences in public. He admitted to killing the little boy in an interview from 2004 after being bullied by other children. According to Smith’s defense attorney John Tunney, Eric was sick of playing the victim and wanted to know what it’s like to be the victim.</p><p><strong>Also Read, <a class=waffle-rich-text-link href=#>Aeko Catori Brown</a>, <a class=waffle-rich-text-link href=#>Jordana Lajoie</a>, and <a class=waffle-rich-text-link href=#>Cogeian Sky Embry</a>.</strong></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Celebrity</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Roddy Jones Wife | Who Is Jackie Jones | Relationship And Wiki Explore</a></h3>Jackie Jones is the lovely wife of American Football wide receiver Roddy Jones.
