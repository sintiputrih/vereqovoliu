Always musically inclined, Okasian would become the top rapper among his peers in high school and would gradually find himself reaching great heights in this genre of music.&nbsp;He then enrolled in college and studied biology.&nbsp;In middle school, Okasian started writing his own lyrics and recording songs.&nbsp;After graduation, the rapper sought a career in music.&nbsp;He returned to Korea to pursue that dream and began a career that had many good days.</span></p><p><span>Okasian belongs to the cohort crew consisting of Keith Ape, JayAllDay, Kangkook, Oscar Lee, B-Free, Bryan Chase, Coke Jazz and AM.KAY.&nbsp;The cohort was formed after Okasian’s invitation by Kangkook and a friend of his from New York.&nbsp;JayAllDay and a few others also joined the crew which gradually became a major group in Asia.&nbsp;The formation of the group worked wonderfully, especially since everyone was passionate about the same style of music.&nbsp;Like Okasian, some members of the music group make music, while others are given other responsibilities.</span></p><p><span>The rapper first signed with Hi-Lite Records;&nbsp;this was after making two mixtapes with The Cohort –&nbsp;</span><span>Pre-Season #1</span><span>&nbsp;released in 2010, and&nbsp;</span><span>Pre-Season #2</span><span>&nbsp;released in 2011. In 2016 he left the label choosing to become an independent artist.&nbsp;Okasian then signed under The Black Label.</span></p><p><span>With the help of CB Mass, Okasian came up with his first Korean album.&nbsp;He also had the help of American rapper Nas who helped produce his first American album.&nbsp;Okasian is popularly known for his hit single,&nbsp;</span><span>This is G Ma</span><span>&nbsp;Keith Ape from the cohort.&nbsp;The Korean rapper described as the star of the group would have discovered Keith Ape when he was a teenager.&nbsp;The song featured JayAllDay, Loota, Okasian and other crew members.</span></p><p><span>The track is said to have embraced the true concept of Korean style, unlike most Korean rap songs which tend to derive more insight from American music.&nbsp;The success of It G Ma also opened up the rapper to more collaborations.&nbsp;The top Korean rapper is known for his unique flows that he releases effortlessly while maintaining a steady balance and tempo.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Family life</span></strong></h2><p><span>Okasian, real name Kim Ji-Yong was born to her parents in the United States.&nbsp;His stage name, Okasian, is a combination of Ok and Asian that sounds like “occasion” when pronounced.&nbsp;The South Korean rapper is also called Alexander Kim – his English name.&nbsp;When he was very small, Okasian was taken to Korea.&nbsp;he returned to America when he was old enough for high school – at the age of sixteen.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Other things to know about the rapper</span></strong></h2><p><span>1. Little is known about the personal life of this talented rapper.&nbsp;Okasian reportedly had a relationship with Soo Yeon in 2015. It has not been verified if the two are still together.</span></p><p><span>2. It G Ma has garnered over 60 million views over the years, casting Khiphop all over the world.</span></p><p><span>3 Like most of his counterparts, Okasian has been embroiled in several feuds with other celebrities in the industry.&nbsp;He got into a fight with Dok2 after he undermined the efforts in It G Ma. At the time, Alexander Kim took to Instagram to applaud Dok2, calling him a “f**kboy.”</span></p><p><span>4. Okasian will hardly go unnoticed with his body covered in tattoos.&nbsp;The rapper’s arms are well covered in tattoos which always set him apart from the rest of the crew.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGinm5bAqq3NZpmip12stqy1jJ%2BYpqGcrnqttcWeZJqmlGKyt7HRsquhoZ6cerq71Galnp2UYsGwecqnprBlkZe8tsCMrZ%2BeZaKWvbGx0Wg%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./revive-me-jett-guy-dead-what-happened-his-cause-of-death-explored-2.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Revive Me Jett Guy Dead: What Happened?
