"It was a portion of a body dismembered and a residence that was covered in blood. So a gruesome scene at best," says Guidry, as reported by <a href=# rel=nofollow>The New York Post.</a></p><p><strong>READ MORE</strong></p><p><a href=# rel>Man arrested for murdering wife who went missing after telling friends she was 'afraid for her life'</a></p><p><a href=# rel>Man killed sleeping wife and flushed body parts down toilet, arrested after DNA evidence found in septic tank</a></p><h2 class=split><strong>Who was Anggy Diaz?</strong></h2><p>Anggy Diaz, a 21-year-old Nicaraguan migrant, had previously worked at the Hispanic shop restaurant and had lately started working as a <a href=# rel>fitness coach</a>. According to a friend of the victim, Diaz revealed to The Post that her new husband is a jealous person. “He posted a video saying, ‘She is mine,’ to social media, and it was weird because no one was questioning that….it was out of no where,” said the friend, who asked not to be named.</p><p>Diaz and her companion had been friends for over four years. Her old coworker and she last saw each other at a Christmas party less than a month ago, which Dicus abruptly left. “Everyone was having a good time and he left looking really upset,” the friend revealed. The newlywed was allegedly coping with domestic violence, according to Diaz's friend. “She never said there were any problems; maybe she was just embarrassed to admit her relationship wasn’t perfect,” she added.</p><h2 class=split><strong>How was Jared Discus caught?</strong></h2><p>Dicus' automobile could be seen pulling up to the meat store in Chepes, where Anggy works, around 11.40 am. In a T-shirt and pants, he is shown in another camera collecting a beer from the refrigerator, strolling casually by the checkout, leaving the store, and then enjoying a beer in the parking lot.</p><p>Dicus was arrested after being found with the 21-year-old woman. Guidry claimed that Discus offered no statement, but that he eventually confessed to the killing. Guidry noted that additional research determined the event occurred on Wednesday at 11 a.m. According to Sheriff Guidry, the murderer used a kitchen knife, according to the evidence, as reported by <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Fox 26.</a> "Everything happened on the property," said Guidry. "And all parts and pieces were recovered and submitted for evidence."</p><p>The woman was found decapitated by law enforcement officials. Dicus' parents informed investigators that their son came inside their home and made a statement that prompted them to search the cottage. At roughly 4.45 pm, Diaz's parents discovered his body and phoned the police. Diaz had been missing since around 11 pm the night before her body was discovered.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/514f5d07-efde-4882-934f-0a97edbe6c3a.jpg><h2 class=split><strong>What is the status of the investigation?</strong></h2><p>The incident's cause is still being investigated. However, cops had confirmed that the couple was known to them, with Guidry saying: "There have been prior calls, disturbance-wise, but nothing to this effect, to this level of violence." According to the confidante, the couple married in a private ceremony in October, stunning friends and family members who were not invited.&nbsp;</p><p>“She told me they eventually wanted to have kids, but I told her to avoid getting pregnant so quickly,” the woman urged Diaz. “I told her to get to know him more and enjoy just being a couple.” Through a GoFundMe website, the victim's loved ones are currently collecting money for the 21-year-old's funeral. According to her friend, Diaz will probably be buried close to Houston, where her mother and aunt reside.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRoopWWubDB0marnrCRqHqurc1mmpqtl53BbrvNZpqapZWnrm6%2F056YpaGenHqjscSrZJqepJq%2Fbr7EqaarrJWZubp5wZ6fnpmUnruoeceiqmavmZuy</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./ammika-harris-posts-new-clip-of-baby-aeko-sleeping-and-gushes-over-him-love-you-more-than-life-itself-363630.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ammika Harris Posts New Clip Of Baby Aeko Sleeping And Gushes Over Him  Love You More Than Lif">&larr;
