And then there is the kind of <strong><a href=#>music</a></strong> that <strong><a href=#>Billie Eilish</a> </strong>puts out into the world. Her songs have good beats, but they also describe a range of emotions that prove that she is wise beyond her years. The singer is only 21 years old and has already made a massive impact on the industry. Fans love that she bares her soul in her songs and that she writes with her older brother, Finneas O'Connell.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Billie Eilish has had a few relationships, including one with the much older Jesse Rutherford. The two are no longer together. But when they were still dating, Eilish talked about how well they got along and how happy she was. Was Billie Eilish thinking about Jesse Rutherford when she wrote some of her hit songs?</p><h2 id=what-are-billie-eilish-39-s-most-popular-songs>What Are Billie Eilish's Most Popular Songs?</h2><p>A few years before <a href=#>Billie Eilish and Jesse Rutherford's relationship</a> started, Eilish released her first two albums and became the success that fans know and love her for today. She has won seven Grammy awards, including Best New Record for her single "Bad Guy."</p><p>When she released her debut album "When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?" in March 2019, it was a huge hit. Some of her most popular songs include "Bad Guy" and "When The Party's Over."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/instar52673993.jpg><p>The album is a special one because Eilish and her brother O'Connell worked on it in her room. As he told Billboard, “We made the whole thing in the bedroom. People are often like, ‘When you think about when you first started making music to like now, from a bedroom to a studio…’ — and we’re like, ‘No. We’re still in the same bedroom.'”</p><p>Eilish also told Billboard, “This album is all me. Nobody’s name. It’s kind of like a coming-of-age album. I’m 17. I did mostly everything for the first time last year. So it’s weird. Like, you know, I learned how to drive last year.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Billie Eilish Really Spends Her Incredible Net Worth</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In July 2021, the singer put out her second album, "Happier Than Ever."

She explained on 102.7KIISFM, “The initial idea for the song is like people that have to tell everybody that they are a certain way all the time?"</p><p>She continued, "If you’re going around all the time saying like, ‘Yeah, I’m bad, I’m always breaking rules, and doing this and doing that.’ You’re not.

She said about Finneas O'Connell, "We see each other all the time, and also now, we’re starting to make music again. We just started the process of making an album, which is really exciting.”</p><p>Since the singer is known for writing about her personal life, it seems likely that album number three will include a few tunes about Rutherford.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/just-how-bad-was-jesse-rutherford-s-breakup-with-devon-lee-carlson-before-dating-billie-eilish_.jpg><p>And now that Eilish is in her early 20s and has learned a lot about writing music, it will be interesting to see what her new songs are like.

She announced it on Instagram and wrote in the caption, "this is one of my favorite songs i’ve ever written. i feel very vulnerable putting this one out because i hold it so close to my heart. this is about many different situations that we’ve all either witnessed or experienced. i hope this can inspire change. try not to abuse your power."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Billie Eilish Just Wants To 'Exist,' Questions Fans' Support Amid Claims She's A Sellout</a></span></p><p>According to Insider.com, people thought that "Your Power" told the story of her ex-boyfriend Brandon Adams, who goes by "Q." Eilish said in an interview with Rolling Stone, "Everybody needs to shut up." Because he was 24 at the time that he dated Eilish, who was 19, people wondered about the age difference.
