He was 67 years old.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=488 data-current-count=488 data-injectable=true>Searching for the perfect abandoned storage locker to buy, the father and son duo occasionally served as a comedic force on select episodes between 2015 and 2019. Rene shared the news of his dad’s passing on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a> the day after. Admitting it took several attempts to make the “hard” video, the teary-eyed treasure hunter revealed that Gunter was diagnosed with lung cancer six months prior. Gunter had smoked for 30 years, Rene said, but had stopped in the last 10.</p><p data-characters=499 data-current-count=499 data-injectable=true>“Last night he passed away in his sleep peacefully from complications from lung cancer,” Rene said. “He had all kinds of holes in his lungs — there was nothing else the doctors could do. I’m only making this video because a lot of you people connected with my dad. You know, my dad was one of the guys on Storage Wars that never really got any hate. People just loved being around him, including the crew, including everybody — everybody loved working with my dad.”</p><p data-characters=141 data-current-count=141 data-injectable=false>Rene said that he and his family had remained quiet about Gunter’s health status because they were optimistic that he’d recover.</p><h2 id=h-gunter-was-an-actor-photographer-and-musician data-injectable=false>Gunter was an actor, photographer and musician</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=441 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=499 data-current-count=499 data-injectable=true>According to his <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">IMDB page</a>, Gunter was born in January 1965 in Vienna, Austria.
