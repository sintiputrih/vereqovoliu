The Blackpink member’s sexuality is straight, and she is not dating anyone.</i></b></p><p>Jisoo, a talented South Korean singer and actress, rose to fame as a member of the internationally renowned girl group Blackpink, which YG Entertainment formed in August 2016.</p><p>Alongside fellow members Jennie, Lisa, and Rose, she contributes her remarkable vocal abilities and charismatic presence to the group’s success.</p><p>Her journey in the entertainment industry began when she was introduced as the third member of Blackpink on June 15, 2016. Before her debut, she joined YG Entertainment as a trainee in July 2011.</p><p>Notably, she made memorable appearances in Epik High’s “Spoiler + Happy Ending” (2014) from their album “Shoebox” and Hi Suhyun’s music video for “I’m Different” (2014).</p><p>Beyond her musical works, she ventured into acting, debuting with a cameo role in the 2015 series “The Producers.” Her breakthrough in the acting world came with her foremost leading role in the JTBC series “Snowdrop” (2021–22).</p><p>She was honored with the Best Actress Award at the 2022 Seoul International Drama Awards.</p><h2>Is Jisoo Gay – What Is Her Sexuality?&nbsp;</h2><p>Jisoo’s sexuality has always sparked curiosity among fans, leading to speculations about whether she is gay.

Jisoo, in particular, shows no signs of being bisexual, as there is no evidence of her engaging in intimate relationships with women outside of the other three members of Blackpink.</p><p>It’s important to recognize that her bond with them resembles that of sisters.</p><p>Their interactions go beyond simple displays of affection, like hugging and cheek kisses. They engage in playful banter, tease one another, and participate in various activities that reflect the close bond shared by sisters.</p><p><b>Also Read: </b><a href=#>Abel Tesfaye Ethnicity, Is He Ethiopian?
