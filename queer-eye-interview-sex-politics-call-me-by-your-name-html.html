They’ve been up since 5:30 a.m. doing press and are ravenous — each with different needs and desires. When the waiter asks me what we want to do, I feel a fresh panic wash over me. “Do you mind me taking over?” Porowski says gently. “I’m always that guy, and I’m happy to.” “Yes,” I reply. “I’m being Queer Eye’d!”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjix1oxm8002g3g60430whnq9@published data-word-count=132>Seemingly overnight, the Fab Five have become a cultural force, with book deals, restaurants, and brand collaborations. The first season of the rebooted Queer Eye debuted on Netflix on February 7. Its return isn’t simply a nostalgic throwback in terms of TV programming, but also to an Obama-era optimism, where political and cultural differences could be bridged with active listening, a patterned short-sleeved button-down, and some shiplap. This second season, which premiered on Netflix on June 15, is a continuation of the same production shoot (they filmed all the episodes at once and Netflix split them into two seasons) as they travel around the state of Georgia to various homes, fire stations, and community centers and make people over, but really, attempt to give them a road map to a better self.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjix1oxz7003d3g60huq7hr7a@published data-word-count=117>As Porowski discusses food with the waiter (“It’s going to be the whitest dinner anyone’s had in a long time. I want it to be very conservative and safe,” he says, “[but] I wanted some weird shit!”), the room buzzes with chatter. Van Ness is sitting next to me, affecting a British accent, while Berk noodles a chopstick into his ear. If being queer is about making your own family, they’ve found their television one: It’s intimate and familiar; and when they fight, it’s like siblings. Over the course of the next hour and a half, they discuss what they learned during production, tussle over politics, and compare dating in Los Angeles to dating in New York.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjix1oxqd002l3g60i7l54xla@published data-word-count=35><strong>To start from the beginning, what were your first impressions of each other?</strong><br>Tan France: Can we make it slightly inappropriate?

There was this email that was sent out to this group of us and they were like, “This isn’t the time to be a wallflower. We want to see how everyone gets along.” So if you could just imagine 40 gay men in a hotel ballroom mingling each other to death at seven in the morning. It was like The Hunger Games meets American Idol, plus RuPaul’s Drag Race, and America’s Next Top Model meets rebooted Queer Eye.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjix1oxsq002n3g60xx1jy23u@published data-word-count=25><strong>How would you describe your family dynamic?</strong><br>KB: [pointing] JVN is baby, Antoni is middle brother.

So whether I continue to be the comedian, or the dad to keep us together, or someone to question us, I have a very versatile place among the five of us.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjix1oxte002q3g603ziotun9@published data-word-count=6>AP: This broth smells so good.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjix1oxtm002s3g60xcayi14b@published data-word-count=68><strong>Let’s talk about the second season, which feels like a learning season thematically. You’re ostensibly there to teach other people, but what were you learning yourselves during this process? For example, Tan, you have a learning experience with Skyler, the trans man in episode five.</strong><br>TF: It was important to show. Just because we’re all members of the LGBTQ community doesn’t mean we also know everything about that community.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjix1oxvt002y3g60f2lpyg65@published data-word-count=124>KB: As a culture, people are scared to talk to people they don’t understand, and they’re scared to ask questions because they don’t want to be judged or seen as if they’re ignorant or trying to be malicious. For him [Tan] to have a conversation, as a member of the LGBTQI community, was so special. Because I, myself, Jonathan, I think Antoni, and Bobby had had experience with the trans community. Those questions didn’t come to mind because I’d already evolved past that. We’re giving such a clear breadth of the human experience, but also the LGBT experience as gay men, that allows people to say, “You know what, they’re not all the same, and it’s okay for us to learn from each other.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjix1oxvr002x3g60wlypx6lv@published data-word-count=101><strong>Are you afraid of being judged for not knowing?</strong><br>TF: We have a lot of chats before the episode starts to film, and that was something we talked about. I really pushed to say, yes, I’m nervous that people are going to chastise me in that community for not knowing beforehand. However, I love that I was in a privileged enough position to be able to ask the questions that a lot of people really want to ask around the world, not just America. It gave Skyler, and hopefully the trans community, a vehicle to answer those questions for the wider audience.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjix1oxvb002v3g60yjqjiwul@published data-word-count=27>KB: Anybody who’d want to judge that should look at themselves in the mirror and ask, “why do I want to judge someone who’s growing and learning?”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjix1oxv5002u3g60zi59zlsc@published data-word-count=16>TF: Because I was so uninformed, it was genuine.

When I get them undressed for the first time, trying new clothes on, they see the potential they’ve had their whole lives. That’s super powerful! If we look like shit, we feel like shit. But when we make an effort, it’s amazing what I can do that day when I’m feeling my best. That’s why these heroes [they call the subjects this on the show] have such an emotional connection to clothes.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjix1oxz1003c3g60agl6ne0s@published data-word-count=52>AP: And that’s not to detract from culture.

What happened?</strong>KB: There’s an organization I work with called the Creative Coalition. I bring different celebrities who want to work in politics and entertainment, and who have a passion for art, to meet with politicians who try to get more art funding for schools. And right now, this administration is in the process of wanting to cut the arts in dramatic ways. So we went there to say, “This is why the arts are important.” The chief of staff and a couple other people were very open to hearing about us.

There was no negativity. They were like, “Great, I understand your perspective.” I’ve always been taught that if you want to see effective change, you have to be in rooms with people who tell you you’re not welcome there. I’m not saying I directly heard I’m not welcome, but we know the stance of this administration.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjix1pw8n003t3g60b8akdqv9@published data-word-count=66><strong>We do. Do you feel like that’s effective?</strong><br>KB: I do. I am a black gay man and I have been closed out of many doors. What we learned from generations behind is that it’s our duty to bang the door and say, “No, I have to come in.” What’s that saying? “If you don’t have a seat at the table, you’re most likely on the menu?”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjix1pw8v003v3g606gzudhs7@published data-word-count=168><strong>I would say banging on the door feels like a different dynamic than going into the belly of the beast and having this type of conversation.

Jonathan is really political as well and he has a different approach. His approach is phenomenal, but you need someone else to say, “I’m willing to go into this space.” And at this particular time, every journey that can lead us to where we hope to be is right. What Jonathan and I feel is the same. We want LGBTQ people, we want marginalized people, to get their rights. So if I feel like being in the belly of the beast is going to give me access to maybe change one mind, that’s enough for me to say, “Maybe there’s a victory there.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjix1pw90003x3g60gbc22g5l@published data-word-count=118><strong>[To Jonathan] Do you want to speak about that?</strong><br>JVN: Like Buddha says, honey, there’s many ways to the top of the mountain and everyone has their own way. I just think that, if this was like, November ’16 through some time in ’17, maybe there are multiple things I would’ve advocated. But for me, I can’t normalize the behavior. Two-thousand-and-fifteen Indiana governor Mike Pence is all I need to know to know that I will advocate for change and affect change in a room that isn’t actively trying to kill people. So that’s how I feel about that. But at the same time, what Karamo says is super-duper true. The left in me is saying, “I don’t know!”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjix1pw95003z3g60zziwaz6n@published data-word-count=76><strong>Hypothetical: Would you do a Queer Eye makeover for the </strong><a href=#><strong>Colorado baker the Supreme Court ruled in favor of, who refused to bake a cake for a gay couple</strong></a><strong>?</strong><br>AP: I would.

We received a text from him talking about how he’s received a lot of flak for going on Queer Eye from his religious community. Before the show, he was almost reluctant to do it because he felt the same way. And then after meeting us, we were humanized in his eyes. It was very easy for him to judge an entire group of people that he had never interacted with, and he said that if the world would do the same thing — interact with those groups of people that they hated — most people wouldn’t hate anymore.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjix1pw9800423g60nmvfx3n2@published data-word-count=47>KB: That, to be honest, is exactly why I always feel like I have to put myself in those rooms.

They had never experienced a gay black man who’s raising children as a single father and who came from immigrant parents. The more I was exposing them to my story, it was like, “Oh my gosh! Oh my gosh!” Does it mean I’m changing hearts and everything is going to change right then and there? No. But it’s like Queer Eye — we’ve spent months with Trump supporters. Does it mean that all of a sudden they’re going to change their votes? No. But it does mean that we put ourselves in a position where we said, “Maybe by exposing ourselves, things can change.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjix1pw9b00453g60urmv8ya5@published data-word-count=205>JVN: Personally, where I come from, I have had people my entire life tell me to my face, “I don’t agree with your lifestyle. You should never be able to be married. You’re a faggot.” Pushed down the stairs, “faggot” spray painted on my car. When I say chased around with pitchforks, I’m halfway kidding. So when you close the door [and] walk out of that room, I’m pretty sure I know the type of language that was used to describe what you’d be doing in a place like that. When I walk out of a room with someone like that, I know very clearly the thoughts that are going through their head. Would they say it to my face? No. They’ll shake my hand with a smile on their face, and then they’re going to go and take your mom’s health care, take your children’s health care, and they’re also going to try to take food stamps from people and make sure women need to qualify how much work [they] can get so they can feed their children.

I let you finish your point on the baker and wanting to work with him, so I’m going to finish mine. This is someone who has led a charge from the fanatical wing of the U.S. to disenfranchise gay people and further feed the flames of the right, who says we’re evil and shouldn’t have the right to marry. Exactly what’s going on with Roe v. Wade will be the case for gay marriage if these same people continue to win Supreme Court decisions like they just won. So by legitimizing them, especially the person that has stoked such an intense case against marriage equality, that also presents such a big bone in the side of furthering marriage equality. Because even though this decision was close and it didn’t reverse the decision of the Ninth District and the Colorado board that decides the governing ethics that this baker reversed, that Supreme Court decision wasn’t super-duper clear because it didn’t reverse the initial…</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjix1pw9j004a3g60jyisza45@published data-word-count=147><strong>It was very narrow.</strong><br>JVN: It was very narrow. But once you’ve lived a struggle that is not the struggle you’d have growing up in Montreal or Houston or a bigger city, and really had those people’s policies affect your local life, you have to be very careful. Especially given the opportunity the five of us have been given. To have this platform and have these followers, to be taking interviews and to say lightly that you’d take him [put the baker on the show], I don’t know.
