Mark was found unresponsive in his home on Sunday. Following the news of his death, many wanted to know what Mark's cause of death was, and why his death seemed to happen so suddenly.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What was Mark Howard's cause of death?</h2><p>While the news of Mark's death seemed to come out of nowhere, few details are currently available that explain how Mark died. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">News Channel 5</a>, his long-time employer, reported on the news of his death, but they didn't include any details about how he had died or whether he had been suffering from a health problem. Instead, they focused on his long career with the network, and in the world of Nashville broadcasting more generally.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Mark worked in radio and TV for Nashville for decades.</h2><p>Mark first joined News Channel 5 in 1986 and spent the next 20 years working as the station's weekend sports anchor. During his time in that role, he covered a World Series, a Super Bowl, and some major NASCAR victories. After leaving NewsChannel 5, Mark worked as a broadcaster for a local radio station, where he spent 16 years hosting The Wake Up Zone. Plenty of people still listen to Mark every day, and were devastated by the news of his passing.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Fans mourn Mark's passing.</h2><p>Although we may not know precisely how Mark died, it's clear that his fans will miss him a great deal, and many offered their condolences to his family as they deal with this loss.</p><p>"I want to express my sincere condolences to the Mark Howard family I was a fan of Mark Howard, he loved his son Jack and always talked about him . Mark, Micky, and Frank Wychek were the best 104.5 The Zone team and I will personally miss him. Rest In Peace my friend," one posted on Twitter.</p><p>"Twenty years ago, I was fresh out of college and doing sports in low market TV. The ND said, 'Go cover the Titans.' My first home game, Mark Howard was in the press box/locker room. I watched him. I watched him a lot that season. I learned so much just by watching," another person posted following the news.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Remembering Mark Howard with <a href=#>@BoclairSports</a> now on The <a href=#>@BuckReising</a> Show <a href=#>https://t.co/glWM89mZpA</a></p>— 104-5 The Zone (@1045TheZone) <a href=#>July 25, 2022</a></figure><p>"I was deeply saddened to hear about the passing of Mark Howard.
