The group of accomplished men and women will test each other on different levels while attempting to forge a connection. So, is she Ready to Love?</p><p>Before that, here is what you should know about Jessica. The bio cover details about her age, job, and family members.</p><h3><strong>Jessica Taylor On OWN‚Äôs Ready To Love Season 8</strong></h3><p>Jessica Taylor was introduced to the show as a 38-year-old entrepreneur.</p><p>In July 2023 a brand-new season of Ready to Love premiered. A fresh set of singles will be featured in the following season, who will try to find love on OWN TV while traveling to Dallas. Only on OWN, the new season of Ready to Love will debut on Friday, July 7, 2023, at 8 p.m. ET.</p><p>The press release read, ‚ÄúThese are grown men and women in their 30s and 40s who are seeking the special relationship of a lifetime that has eluded them thus far, and the baggage they each bring to the party is real.‚Äù 18 singles participated in this season of the dating reality show as they bonded with one another in an effort to find love. This dating reality show covers singles in their 30s and 40s, which is unusual for most of them.</p><p>The Ready to Love cast will get to know one another at a Mansion Mixer in Dallas before the program airs. Even before the evening is over, two cast members will say their farewell.</p><p>Following their interactions with the men, the female competitors and the men will both determine which male single they don‚Äôt want to get to know any further. Each week, one single‚Äôs mission to find love ends, therefore the remaining candidates must continue to strive to win each other over. According to the press release, the turmoil, love triangles, and broken hearts will either endanger or strengthen the burgeoning romances. Only ‚Äúthe strongest connections‚Äù will endure, though.</p><p>Before the premiere of the show, she announced the watch party via an IG post, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going down TONIGHT! Ready to Love: Dallas, Premiere and Watch party. Hosted by&nbsp;<a class="x1i10hfl xjbqb8w x6umtig x1b1mbwd xaqea5y xav7gou x9f619 x1ypdohk xt0psk2 xe8uvvx xdj266r x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r xexx8yu x4uap5 x18d9i69 xkhd6sd x16tdsg8 x1hl2dhg xggy1nq x1a2a7pz notranslate _a6hd" tabindex=0 role=link href=#>@jkruzonair</a> I can‚Äôt wait to see you guys, it‚Äôs going to be epic.‚Äù</p><h3><strong>Who Is Jessica Taylor Boyfriend?</strong></h3><p>Jessica Taylor is quiet about her dating life as of the publishment of this article in 2023. But, then again, she wasn‚Äôt very vocal about her past relationship too.</p><h3><strong>Jessica Taylor Age</strong></h3><p>As of July 2023, Jessica Taylor is 38 years old.</p><h3><strong>Who Are Jessica Taylor Parents?</strong></h3><p>Jessica Taylor has also shared stories of her mom on her Facebook. In February 2023, Jessica shared that growing up her mom would make Jessica and her sister walk to the mailbox every week to check the mail. Upon their return, the first thing she would always ask for was her Essence magazine.</p><p>She added, ‚ÄúNo one could read it, or open it before her and she never threw them away. I can only imagine the joy she would have right now to see her very own in her favorite publication. Here‚Äôs to Joyce, here‚Äôs to hard work, here‚Äôs to Ezra, and here‚Äôs to BLACK HISTORY MONTH.‚Äù</p><p>This year, 2023, marked six years of losing her mother. In 2022, Jessica wrote, ‚ÄúOne thing she would ask me in response to anything I had an idea or plan about (trust I had many) was ‚ÄúSo what‚Äôs stopping you, besides you?‚Äù And my answer was always the same‚Ä¶ ‚Äúnothing‚Äù. So whatever it is your thinking about, DO IT. Do it scared, do it broke, do it by yourself I promise you won‚Äôt regret it.‚Äù</p><p>On <a href=#>Father‚Äôs Day 2018</a>, Jessica wished her dad, ‚ÄúHappy Father‚Äôs Day to my one and only!üòò.‚Äù</p><h3><strong>Jessica Taylor Job</strong></h3><p>Jessica Taylor is an entrepreneur and founder of Ezra Coffee. It all began when Jessica‚Äôs grandfather was persuaded by her interest in the potent beverage to give her a sneaky sip of his coffee. Despite her grandmother‚Äôs objections, Jessica developed a passion for coffee as a child that she has kept with her throughout her life.</p><p>Jessica decided to combine her love of equality, storytelling, and coffee into one business, Ezra Coffee, after developing a career working with organizations like Ohio State University and Perdue to promote diverse hiring.</p><p>The premium, responsibly sourced coffee company is committed to sharing the authentic narratives of significant Black personalities. Intentionally naming each flavor after Black leaders or significant cultural occurrences, Jessica also included a little narrative on each flavor‚Äôs packaging for customers to read. Among Ezra‚Äôs most popular blends include Lorde Baldwin, a potent Kenyan mix that pays homage to literary greats James Baldwin and Audre Lorde, and 64th & Tulsa, a medium dark roast that celebrates the significance of Black Wall Street.</p><p>‚ÄúMy goal with Ezra Coffee Co. is to always highlight the stories, legacies, and experiences of African-Americans who have contributed to our collective American history,‚Äù Jessica said. ‚ÄúWith each cup of bold and flavorful coffee, Ezra [Coffee] informs, empowers, and inspires coffee connoisseurs and novices everywhere.‚Äù</p><p>In just two years, the brand has secured nationwide distribution in&nbsp;<span class=skimlinks-unlinked>Target.com</span>&nbsp;and H.E.B. stores nationwide.</p><p>‚ÄúEzra is a premium brand and each bag comes from the heart,‚Äù she told ESSENCE. ‚ÄúI really believe customers can taste that. I‚Äôm also integrating the stories that are pivotal to Black into the DNA of the brand, which is incredibly important. Our stories deserve to be told in a beautiful, thoughtful way.‚Äù</p><p>Some of Ezra‚Äôs best-selling blends include 64th & Tulsa, Lorde Baldwin, Le Grand Duc 1928, and Toasted Southern Pecan.</p><h3><strong>Jessica Taylor Height</strong></h3><p>Jessica Taylor‚Äôs height measures under 5 feet 6.5 inches.</p><h3><strong>Related FAQs</strong></h3><ul><li><h4><strong>When Is Jessica Taylor Birthday?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Jessica Taylor‚Äôs birthday is on 20 June.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>Is Jessica Taylor On Instagram?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Yes, Jessica Taylor is on Instagram (<a href=#>@jesstaylor59</a>) and Facebook (<a href=#>@jesykah.taylor</a>).</p><ul><li><h4><strong>Where Is Jessica Taylor From?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Per her Facebook, Jessica Taylor is living in Dallas, Texas.
