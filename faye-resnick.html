Resnick, a conceded cocaine fiend, went to numerous medication recovery programs in the eight years going before November 1994. he was depicted by performing artist Connie Britton in the TV arrangement American Crime Story: The People v. O. J. Simpson which depends on the O. J. Simpson trial.</p><p>Resnick teamed up on two books associated with the O. J. Simpson kill trial, named, Nicole Brown Simpson: The Private Diary of a Life Interrupted and Shattered: In the Eye of the Storm. Likewise, Her first book described the death of Nicole Brown Simpson which took the market very effectively.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Indeed, it was a success and also known to be a bestseller, The L.A. Times even named it as “the first of the major O.J. Simpson books to hit the shelves”. Eventually, it sold about 750k hard copies in total. Moreover, her second book Shattered portrayed her involvement with O.J.

The two women have some bad blood, stemming from one of the biggest names in history: O.J. Simpson.</p><p>To play catch up: Edwards confronted Resnick on RHOBH — at a dinner party, of course — about what Resnick wrote about Edwards in her 1994 book. The conversation didn’t go well for either woman, but it definitely did raise the question of what exactly was written about Edwards in the book, and if it is as character-damning as Edwards alleges.</p><p>Just months after her close friend, Nicole Brown Simpson, was killed, Resnick released Nicole Brown Simpson: The Private Diary of a Life Interrupted, and Edwards’ name is brought up in the text. According to an article about the book, posted by Bravo, during a time of reconciliation, Resnick penned that O.J. allegedly wanted to know the names of the people with who Nicole allegedly slept during their separation, which is when Edwards is mentioned by name.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-915 data-method=placement-service></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span><p>The Bravo article stated that Resnick wrote that Nicole allegedly admitted to having an affair with Marcus Allen, Edwards’ soon-to-be-husband at the time. (People reported that Edwards and Allen both denied the accusations.) Here’s the passage containing claims about the alleged affair.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>That’s not all that was said about Edwards in the book, though. The Bravo article about the book also quoted an alleged conversation Resnick had with her friend Kris Jenner about a relationship Allen was allegedly trying to pursue with Resnick.</p><p>Allen’s attorney, Ed Hookstratten, responded to the author’s accusations on behalf of his client when it was published in 1994. “Although there may be some truth about some things in the book when it relates to Marcus Allen it is absolutely false,” he said. Bustle reached out to Jenner for comment but has not yet received a reply.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-916 data-method=placement-service></span><p>Edwards seems to want to air all of her grievances with Resnick now that the two women are running in the same circle. Resnick, on the other hand, doesn’t seem to be willing to talk about that time in her life at all, probably because the first time it was brought up on RHOBH this happened.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span><h2 id=h-faye-resnick-oj-simpson>Faye Resnick OJ Simpson</h2><p>Faye Resnick was reviled during the O.J.
