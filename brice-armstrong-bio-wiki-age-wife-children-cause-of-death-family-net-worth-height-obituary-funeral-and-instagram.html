He rose to fame when he narrated the Funimation dub of Dragon Ball, before going on to join the cast of Dragon Ball Z as the voice of Captain Ginyu. He later returned to the franchise as the narrator of the fourth Dragon Ball film, before playing Lord Slug in Dragon Ball Z: Lord Slug.</p><p>He also voiced a number of other roles, including Douglas on Lupin III and roles in Baki the Grappler, Fullmetal Alchemist, Fruits Basket, and Yu Yu Hakusho.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=brice-armstrong-age></span> Brice Armstrong Age<br><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Brice Armstrong was born on January 3, 1936, in Dallas, Texas, United States. He died on January 10, 2020. He was 84 years old.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=brice-armstrong-wife></span> Brice Armstrong Wife<br><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Brice Armstrong’s wife was Marianna Ash from 1966 until her death on May 16, 2008.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=brice-armstrong-children></span> Brice Armstrong Children<br><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Armstrong had 12 children.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=brice-armstrong-death></span> Brice Armstrong Death<br><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Brice Armstrong died on January 10, 2020, at age 84. His talent management group Mary Collins Agency has confirmed his death in a statement on Facebook.</p><p>“I’m sad to say we lost a dear client and friend, voice actor Brice Armstrong, on Friday, January 10th, 2020. He died of natural causes at his home at age 84. Although many of you might not know Brice’s work, as he retired in 2009, many more of you knew Brice as an exceedingly talented voice actor, and a very sweet, funny guy.</p><p>“Brice began working at KRLD Radio/TV in 1964, moving to KLIF Radio as part of the long-running Charlie & Harrigan show, even though none of them were named Charlie or Harrigan! He went on to work for several other radio stations including WRR, and was inducted into the Texas Radio Hall of Fame in 2004.</p><p>“Brice began doing voiceovers for commercials after his years in radio. In the late 70s and early 80s, when I was a VO casting director and radio producer at the Bloom Agency, I booked him often. Brice was one of our go-to voices. At the time, Joy Wyse represented him until she retired in 1992. I then had the privilege of becoming his agent until he retired.</p><p>“James Earl Jones once told Brice, “I wish I had your vocal control.” But even though he was a gifted voice actor and announcer, he was so self-effacing you might never know it was his profession. Always camera-shy, Brice would only allow his photo be taken from the back or side, usually at a mic. He was known for his “big announcer” voice, along with an ear for celebrity impressions. One of our early promotions for Brice—and as his friends knew, he eschewed almost any attention or promotion—asked, “How could you get Jimmy Stewart, John Wayne, Alfred Hitchcock, Cary Grant, Ed Wynn, Bela Lugosi and Johnny Cash in the same studio at the same time? Simple. Call Mary Collins and ask for Brice Armstrong.”</p><p>“In addition to hundreds of radio and TV voiceovers and industrial narrations, Brice was the first live announcer on Good Morning, Texas when it premiered on WFAA in the fall of 1994. He was also the voice of Miss Etta Kette on several seasons of Barney & Friends. In the anime and game community, Brice is perhaps best known as the narrator for the original Dragonball series, characters Captain Ginyu and Lord Slug in Dragonball Z, as well as providing voices on Yu Yu Hakusho, Lupin III, Case Closed and many other titles.</p><p>“Christopher Sabat, a Mary Collins Agency voice actor and founder of Okratron 5000, worked with and directed Brice often. “Brice was the kindest, funniest person I’ve ever known. He was always humble, never in a bad mood–not the attitude you’d expect from such an industry legend.”</p><p>“After Brice retired, he presented me the incredible gift of his entire Hollywood book library. (We shared that passion.) At our offices, on one of the bookcases that holds his beloved collection, we have a plaque that says: Brice Armstrong Entertainment Library. “I have to Sally Forth!” As friends and colleagues will recall, it was one of his signature phrases. Ric Spiegel, long-time Mary Collins Agency client and voice actor, worked often with Brice. Hearing of Brice’s passing Ric said, “I like to think Brice is sitting on a stool in the big recording booth in the sky, leaning forward into the mic and announcing, ‘Sally Forth!’ No second take needed.”</p><p>“Brice was preceded in death by his beloved wife of 42 years, Marianna, who passed away in 2008. He is survived by six children, several of who predictably ended up in the theatrical and gaming industries: Daughter Robin Armstrong, Sons Joshua Armstrong and wife Marianne, Joseph Armstrong, Paul Armstrong and wife Rebecca; Matthew Armstrong and wife Emily; Anthony Armstrong and wife Nha; and nine grandchildren: Mason, Jasmine, Diana, Alexander, Evelyn, Ashley, Elizabeth, Ryken and Logan.”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=brice-armstrong-family></span> Brice Armstrong Family<br><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>According to Mary Collins Agency, Brice Armstrong is survived by six children, several of who predictably ended up in the theatrical and gaming industries: Daughter Robin Armstrong, Sons Joshua Armstrong and wife Marianne, Joseph Armstrong, Paul Armstrong and wife Rebecca; Matthew Armstrong and wife Emily; Anthony Armstrong and wife Nha; and nine grandchildren: Mason, Jasmine, Diana, Alexander, Evelyn, Ashley, Elizabeth, Ryken and Logan.”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=brice-armstrong-cause-of-death></span> Brice Armstrong Cause of Death<br><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Brice Armstrong’s cause of death was natural causes.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=brice-armstrong-net-worth></span> Brice Armstrong Net Worth<br><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaJqinrCmecCrpKysoqS7qHnBoqZmr5mgtm6txp5ksKGWmnqktMilm6udnmKwosHSnmSonl2ZsqLAx2admqWZocZuusStZLCnoqm1brTEop6hrF2kr6rA1JqpsmWWqrumvsClZJqmlGK2r7%2FTmp6rmZ1k</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./ronald-fenty.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ronald Fenty">&larr;
