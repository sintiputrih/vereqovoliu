In 2001, the couple first met in Manhattan. After dating for three years, they had their twin daughters, Lola and Bella, on October 14, 2004. Their marriage, however, did not last long, and they divorced after nine years.</p><p>His parents’ divorce, Alejandra and Steve, went public on the same day he was born when Steve announced that they were divorcing. In addition to the happy news of Matteo’s birth, he announced the sad news of his divorce from his first wife.</p><p>According to him, they had been living apart for some months. With the announcement came suspicions about Alejandra’s relationship with Steve’s coworker Jason Richardson, leading some to suspect Matteo was not his child.</p><p>The rumor, however, was later proven to be false. Alejandra stated that the couple desired a son after having two daughters and had been planning Matteo for a year.</p><h2><span id=Matteo_has_two_older_sisters_Lola_and_Bella>Matteo has two older sisters, Lola and Bella</span></h2><p>He is the younger brother of his six-year-old twin sisters, Lola Nash and Bella Nash.

When Steve was dealt to the Los Angeles Lakers in 2012, she did not pass up the opportunity for the second time.</p><p>She sought child support in California courts, but Steve was opposed to her plan to relocate from Arizona to Los Angeles and refused to assist her.</p><p>He did not give his ex-wife any money, but he did pay for 90% of the children’s medical, educational, and extracurricular activities fees, as well as 80% of the nannies’ income. They eventually worked out their differences.</p><h2><span id=The_Second_Wedding>The Second Wedding</span></h2><p>Steve is currently married to Lilla Frederick, a former volleyball player.
