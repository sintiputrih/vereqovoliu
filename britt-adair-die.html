While the Nightmares hadn‚Äôt had the opportunity to share a stage with them yet, all 4 of us had done so with our previous bands. Britt was a true pillar for the Kansas City pink rock community over the last 10+ years flying the flag loud and proud for all to see. To say that she will be missed would be a massive understatement. We send our deepest condolences today out to her family and all of the KC music community that knew her.

I am completely gutted to learn of the passing of an iconic musician, Britt Adair of <a href=# rel=noopener>The Bad Ideas</a>. I was closer to Britt than I am with most musicians we cover, likely because we were about the same height and could see eye-to-eye. I took this photo in 2014 at Middle of the Map Fest to show her statuesque presence onstage. Britt was an absolute icon and inspired us to be a better photographer. Our hearts are with Britt‚Äôs band and her mother, who we were also fond of. I am mourning right along each and every one of you right now.</p><p><strong>Ultraman&nbsp;Wrote,&nbsp;</strong></p><p>This is Britt Adair, guitarist for Bad Ideas in Kansas City. Unfortunately she passed away yesterday. The first time I met Britt was when Ultraman opened for Zero Boys in KC. She was not only up front rocking out during our set but singing along to songs from the first album. That blew my mind because I was convinced it was released either before or not long after she was born. Shows in KC will never be the same. She was not only on a fan of punk rock but a participant.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-115 data-inserter-version=2></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiqkZ%2ButLDEp6uapJOkua2xxp5lnKedZK%2BztdOtZJqckZ6%2FbrDInmY%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./best-queer-coded-characters-literature.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Is he...you know?: Literature's best queer-coded characters">&larr;
