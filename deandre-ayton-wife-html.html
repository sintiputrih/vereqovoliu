And it is not a surprise, given that his fame has only increased since he joined the NBA in 2018.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>The more he makes it to&nbsp;the headlines with his stellar gameplay, the greater attention he receives regarding his dating relationship. In consequence, his followers can't help but wonder,&nbsp;</p><h2>Does&nbsp;Deandre Ayton Have a Wife?</h2><p>Since Ayton has been in the spotlight as the player of the NBA, he has never mentioned having a wife. That is to say, the basketball player is probably unmarried as of this time of writing. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>But that doesn't mean he has no potential wife in his life. The&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>Phoenix Suns star</a> has been in a long relationship with his girlfriend,&nbsp;Anissa Evans.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>According to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Essentially Sports</a>, Evans is a Bahamian model from Nassau, the hometown of Ayton.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>She has five members in her family, including her three siblings and her parents â€”&nbsp;father Andrae and mother Melissa.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The model graduated from Jupiter High School&nbsp;in 2017 and enrolled at&nbsp;Queen's College.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Ayton and Evans&nbsp;reportedly started dating since Ayton passed the NBA draft. But in his early career, they took an apparent break.</p><p>Ayton was seen going out with another woman named Brooke in 2019.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>However, the short-termed fling didn't last long, for Ayton rekindled his romance with his former partner.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Since the reconciliation, Ayton and Evans have been going strong in their relationship, taking one step at a time.&nbsp;They have even already created their family by welcoming a baby boy.&nbsp;</p><h2>Deandre Ayton Has a Son with Girlfriend</h2><p>Ayton and Evans might not yet be husband and wife, but they have already given birth to a baby boy. Their son,&nbsp;Deandre Ayton Jr., was born in early 2021.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p></p><p><strong>Deandre Ayton's baby mama&nbsp;Anissa Evans&nbsp;and his son.&nbsp;</strong>(Photo: Anissa Evans' <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>)&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>The 22-year-old announced the birth of his son when he returned to the court&nbsp;after the All-Star break in March 2021.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>"I was busy delivering my firstborn, to be honest," Ayton&nbsp;told The Undefeated (via <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Phoenix Suns community</a>), implying he had got no break during the gap.</p><p>He&nbsp;also noted that his life had become different since having his kid.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Ayton acknowledged the pressure of fatherhood. He mentioned he had to be a wonderful dad for his son and set an example.&nbsp;</p><p>"And I named him after me, so I got a legacy for him to continue for me. So I got a lot to do," he added.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Ayton explained he couldn't express his feeling.&nbsp;In his own words, he just knew that he had gotten duties beyond basketball and was ready to face all tribulations.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p><strong>Deandre Ayton with his girlfriend Anissa Evans&nbsp;and his son&nbsp;Deandre Ayton Jr. </strong>(Photo:&nbsp;Deandre Ayton's Instagram)</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Amid the interview, the father-of-one shared he was helping his baby mama as much as possible.</p><p>He stated he was&nbsp;waking up at 3 a.m.,&nbsp;going back to sleep for another two hours, and getting the hang of that.&nbsp;</p><p>As apparent in his Instagram, Ayton has been enjoying his fatherhood and family time with his baby mama and son.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-175 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The three of them&nbsp;dressed in The&nbsp;Incredibles&nbsp;costume for Halloween 2021.
