He also released another track&nbsp;</span><span>Serendipity</span><span>&nbsp;which was included in the album,&nbsp;</span><span>Love Yourself</span><span>.&nbsp;Jimin reportedly broke boundaries with his two solo tracks making waves on the Billboard Korea charts.</span></p><p><span>He did not stop there, the singer also collaborated a lot with the group.&nbsp;Together with one of BTS member Jungkook, he made&nbsp;</span><span>Christmas Day,</span><span>&nbsp;tagged the Korean version of the song&nbsp;</span><span>Mistletoe</span><span>&nbsp;by Justin Bieber.&nbsp;A few other collaborations followed before Jimin appeared in the series&nbsp;</span><span>Hello Counselor, Please Take Care of My Fridge</span><span>&nbsp;and a few other shows.</span></p><p><span>In December 2018, Jimin released his first solo work without BTS Crew titled&nbsp;</span><span>Promise</span><span>.&nbsp;Besides, the South Korean music star is also known for his unique dance moves which sets him apart from the rest of the K-Pop group.</span></p><h2><strong><span>His brother and his family</span></strong></h2><p><span>The names of Jimin’s parents are not known.&nbsp;However, it is known that the talented artist is the eldest of his parents and grew up with his father and mother.&nbsp;Jimin’s father owns a cafe called Alice’s Table in Busan.&nbsp;Jimin is not the only child of his parents, he has a younger brother, a brother named Park Jihyun.&nbsp;There is not much information regarding his brother;&nbsp;However, we already know that they grew up together.</span></p><p><span>The singer’s love for his family is seen in the film as he gushes over them on social media.&nbsp;He often posts videos and photos of precious moments shared with his family, leaving his followers in awe of his wonderful loved ones.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Does he have a girlfriend?</span></strong></h2><p><span>Jimin always leaves his fans and the general public curious about vague reports about his personal life.&nbsp;What’s even more disturbing is that it’s almost the same with all members of the K-pop group, BTS.&nbsp;Jimin’s discretion about his love life as well as that of the other members now leaves his fans endlessly guessing who might be the one who might be the first.</span></p><p><span>Although many names have come up, the singer is believed to be single at the moment.&nbsp;He was once rumored to have a relationship with Han Seung-Yeon from KARA.&nbsp;However, he never responded to the rumors regarding his love life.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Body measurements: height and weight</span></strong></h2><p><span>BTS’s Jimin would hardly go unnoticed with his outstanding handsome looks.&nbsp;Who wouldn’t give her dazzling eyes and glowing face a second look?&nbsp;Its average height is 1.75 m and its proportional weight is 61 kg.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGivmKR6qr%2BMo6CmoZ5is7O7zGaZratdnba0eceeoKCgpGLEprXGoatmmZeaeqO%2Bzq2fnqpdlrulecaiqaWeop6yr7CO</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./21-savage-kodak-black-response-drake.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="21 Savage Calls Cap On Kodak Blacks Claims He Changed Post-Drake">&larr;
