The watch first debuted in 1983 and has been spotted on superstars like Madonna and Jane Fonda. It only makes sense that Rihanna would have one for herself. She's also the owner of a rose gold Patek Philippe Nautilus watch. The average price for that watch starts at around $150,000.</p><p>She also has a few watches that appear to be just below the six-figure mark... which is nothing to sneeze at, that's for sure.
