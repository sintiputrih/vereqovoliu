As a result, even when a musician makes it, it often doesn’t take them very long for them to largely disappear again.When the band Maroon 5 rose to fame, most people thought they were likely to fade away before too long. However, many years after they were introduced to the world, Maroon 5 remained successful enough that <a href=#>they played the Super Bowl Halftime Show</a> in 2019.<span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>10 Little-Known Facts About Maroon 5 Members</a></span>As a result of the fact that Maroon 5 has remained popular for so long, the group’s frontman Adam Levine has become one of the most talked about singers of his generation. On top of that, there has also been a lot of discussion about Levine’s personal life including <a href=#>a love triangle he was a part of</a>.Unfortunately for Adam Levine and his family, in 2022 an Instagram model named Sumner Stroh came forward and accused him of carrying on an affair with her. Now that Stroh is in the headlines, it begs an obvious question, will she cash in on being at the center of a major scandal?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=adam-levine-and-sumner-stroh-rsquo-s-cheating-scandal>Adam Levine And Sumner Stroh’s Cheating Scandal</h2><p>After Adam Levine became famous, the Maroon 5 frontman met a Victoria’s Secret model named Behati Prinsloo in 2012. At that point, Levine and Prinsloo dated, broke up, reunited, and then wound up getting married in 2014.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>10 Little-Known Facts About Adam Levine's Wife, Behati Prinsloo</a></span></p><p>Once Adam Levine and Behati Prinsloo got married, the couple went on to welcome their two daughters into the world in 2016 and 2018. On top of that, Levine often spoke about how much he adored his wife and she played a major role in Maroon 5’s music video for their song “Girls Like You”.</p><p>In 2022, Adam Levine and Behati Prinsloo’s relationship wound up in the spotlight for a really sad reason. In September, a 23-year-old Instagram and TikTok model named Sumner Stroh uploaded a video to the latter social media network <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">claiming she had an affair with Levine</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On top of claiming that she carried on an affair with Adam Levine for “about a year”, Sumner Stroh also shared images of private messages she received from the Maroon 5 singer.</p><p>While speaking about the alleged affair she had with Adam Levine, Sumner Stroh said tried to explain she was immature when she got involved with him. “At the time, you know, I was young, I was naïve, and, I mean, quite frankly, I feel exploited.”</p><p>After news of Sumner Stroh’s claims went public, Adam Levine publically denied having an affair with her only hours later. However, Levine did state that he shared inappropriate texts with Stroh.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I used poor judgment in speaking with anyone other than my wife in ANY kind of flirtatious manner. I did not have an affair, nevertheless, I crossed the line during a regrettable period of my life. In certain instances it became inappropriate. I have addressed that and taken proactive steps to remedy this with my family.”</p><p>“My wife and my family is all I care about in this world. To be this naive and stupid enough to risk the only thing that truly matters to me was the greatest mistake I could ever make. I will never make it again. I take full responsibility. We will get through it and we will get through it together.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Stroh has countered his response, claiming that he should get a "dictionary".</p><h2 id=will-sumner-stroh-cash-in-on-the-adam-levine-affair-scandal>Will Sumner Stroh Cash In On The Adam Levine Affair Scandal?</h2><p>Anytime a mostly unknown person comes forward to accuse a famous person of something, a lot of people begin wondering aloud if their motivation is money.</p><p>Of course, Sumner Stroh is the only person who can truly know what her motivation is for speaking publically about Adam Levine. However, it is worth noting that there isn’t any indication that Stroh’s motivation was money aside from random observers’ suspicions.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Adam Levine’s Comments On Bands Being A “Dying Breed” Creates Controversy Among Music Fans</a></span></p><p>Putting aside any conversation about why Sunmver Stroh claimed she had an affair with Adam Levine in public, there is still the question of if she will cash in. While Stroh is the only person who will have access to her bank accounts, the fact is that she almost certainly will make money from this situation.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since Sumner Stroh claimed she had an affair with Adam Levine on social media, it is all but certain that a large group of people will seek out her Instagram and TikTok accounts. Even if a small portion of those people decides to follow her, that will make a big difference in her numbers.</p><p>Now that social media has been around for many years, a lot of people have figured out how to monetize followers. Since Sumner Stroh already was an Instagram model, she clearly is aware of those techniques, and it is all but certain she will employ them.</p><p>When people go to Sumner Stroh’s Instagram account, her profile includes a link that allows them to access her OnlyFans account. Of course, <a href=#>the top OnlyFans users make lots of money</a>. While Stroh’s OnlyFans is free as of this writing, if she adds a paid tier the money probably will come rolling in.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Another option Sumner Stroh also has is to be like other influencers who <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">make thousands by uploading sponsored posts</a> online.</p><p>According to showbizcorner.com, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sumner Stroh currently has a $2 million net worth</a>. While that certainly isn’t the most reliable source, whatever Stroh’s current net worth is it will likely grow in the weeks to come.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiqrqWemr9uv9OrpqFlnprBbsPOq6uhZZGZrq55y56toqaVYrCpscCtoKefXaiworrDmqNo</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./theo-epsteins-net-worth-biography-career-awards-fact-and-life-story.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Theo Epsteins Net Worth, Biography, Career, Awards, Fact and Life Story">&larr;
