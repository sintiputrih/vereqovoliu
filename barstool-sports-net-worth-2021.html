However, as the company’s operations progressed, it received significant investments and grew to become one of the largest and best digital media companies in the world.</p><p>This corporation made a significant shift after launching its business on the internet in 2007. As a result, AOL, an American online service provider that also operates a web portal, began broadcasting Barstool Sports’ entire online content. This was one of the primary reasons for Barstool Sports’ success.</p><p>Later that year, David Portnoy called an emergency press conference in Times Square to announce that The Chernin Group had acquired the majority stake in Barstool Sports, with the Chernin Group owning 51 percent of both Barstool Sports and its website. As a result, the headquarters of Barstool Sports were relocated from Milton to New York City.</p><h2>More On Evolution</h2><p>Following that, Mike Kerns, the president of Chernin Group, was interviewed on Portnoy’s podcast, The Dave Portnoy Show, about the acquisition. In this podcast, they revealed how they met, stating that they met through a common acquaintance named Jared Lorenzen.</p><p>Following The Chernin Group’s acquisition of Barstool Sports in 2016, David remained the site’s primary controller as well as its creative force. Erika Nardini, a former AOL marketing officer, was named CEO of the company later that year, on July 19, 2016.</p><p>Following that, the company began airing The Barstool Rundown Live, a televised version of the Barstool program, on Comedy Central. This show grew in popularity after Indianapolis Colts quarterback Andrew Luck announced his retirement from the NFL to work on this site in 2017. Michael Rapaport was also announced in June 2017 to join Barstool Sports as a podcast host. Following that, they began producing a number of podcasts, which have played an important role in the company’s growth.</p><p>Finally, in 2020, Penn National Gaming formed a partnership with Barstool Sports, through which they purchased 36% of their stake, increasing the company’s net worth. Following that, Barstool Sportsbook, a mobile sports betting application, was released.</p><h2>Net Worth of Barstool Sports 2023</h2><p>The net worth of Barstool Sports has increased as a result of its continuous revolution, which has contributed to its success.<strong> As of November 2023, Barstool Sports has a net worth of $120 million</strong>, a significant increase from its previous assessment, which was based on a net worth of $100 million in 2018.</p><p><a href=# data-wpel-link=internal><strong>Related post: Pawn Stars Net Worth 2022</strong></a></p><h2>Summary</h2><p><strong>Barstool Sports</strong> went from a word-of-mouth sensation to an overnight sensation in a matter of days.
