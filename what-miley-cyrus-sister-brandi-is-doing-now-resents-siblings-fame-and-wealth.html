She told the publication, “Now that I’m DJing and playing these bigger clubs where house music is expected, I started to really dive into it and figure out what house and electronic music I enjoy. When I play these remixes in the club, there is a vibe for sure. It’s fun to mix electronic music with the hip-hop stuff that I love because there is a way to do both. To me, that’s the creative art of DJing… making it all work together.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In October 2023, Brand will DJ an event called The Villains' Ball ft.

My dad is the biggest star on the planet and you want to make fun of me?' As I'm older now, I look back on that and that's just so insane. I don't know why people like to tear others down to make themselves feel better. I don't know what it is but, yes, Miley is a huge personality.
