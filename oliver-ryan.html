He is currently <strong>28 years old</strong> and his sun sign is Taurus. He has an elder brother named Bob. Oliver and his family later moved to Wiltshire, England, where he attended ‘Dauntsey’s School.’ He continued his academics at ‘St. Joseph’s in Devizes, Wiltshire.

Source: Instagram</p><p>Oliver was never interested in academics. He discovered his passion for video games at a very young age and always wished to make a career out of his passion. Although he scored well in ‘The General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE),’ he was reluctant to go to college. Instead, he started his internet business and sold gadgets and other items online.</p><p>His father’s persuasion made him attend the ‘Sixth Form’ college. He enrolled at ‘St John’s College’ in Marlborough, where he chose media studies, biology, and geography as his subjects. Oliver soon got bored with his studies. His attendance suffered, as he began devoting more time to his internet business. Oliver plays a variety of games online, but his favorite genre is shooting games. His all-time favorite movie is the 2010 American comedy film ‘Grown Ups’.</p><h2><span id=Professional_Life>Professional Life</span></h2><p>He was exposed to gaming while in primary school. Since then, he has been passionate about gaming. In his early teens, Oliver attended the ‘Eurogamer Expo (EGX),’ for the first time. The event is an annual trade fair for video games held in the UK. He loved everything about the event.</p><p>Later, returning from the event, Oliver was sure about his career choice. He attended the event for the second time after completing college. Fascinated by the concept of gaming on YouTube, Oliver decided to create a channel of his own.</p><p>On September 30, 2013, Oliver launched his first YouTube channel, ‘<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">MasterOv</a>‘, which later became his online pseudonym. The term “Ov” consists of the initials of his first and middle names. The channel hosts walkthrough gameplay for games such as ‘Minecraft’ and ‘Clash of Clans.’ In addition, Oliver has played a lot of other popular games, such as ‘GTA 5,’ ‘Diep.io,’ ‘Slither.io,’ ‘Bloons TD Battles,’ and ‘Pokémon Go.’</p><p>The channel is now a sensation and one of the most-viewed gaming channels on YouTube, with over two million subscribers. In January 2015, the channel attained the 87th position on the list of the most-viewed gaming channels worldwide.</p><p>Further, Oliver has a vlog channel, too, named ‘Hollie & Ollie.’ He manages the channel with his girlfriend, Hollie. Originally, it was a gaming channel named ‘OVPlays,’ which he had created along with his ex-fiancée. It currently has a subscription count of around 250 thousand. Moreover, he had also created his third channel, ‘Grand MasterOv,’ which was supposed to be an online chess game channel. However, the channel is inactive now.</p><p><span>Despite his popularity and fame, he has not received any brand endorsement deals as of now. However, it is possible that shortly, he might start to endorse brands.&nbsp;</span></p><h2><span id=Personal_Life>Personal Life</span></h2><p>He previously dated, <strong>Charlotte Dyer</strong>. He met her in college and instantly fell in love with her. Charlotte was already in a relationship then but broke up a month after she met Oliver. Soon, Charlotte and Oliver became friends. Ultimately, their relationship blossomed into a passionate romantic affair. They got engaged, too, but broke up soon after.</p><p>Oliver is now in a relationship with Hollie, who is a model. They gave birth to a daughter named Ravenna Sarina in 2017.&nbsp; Oliver and Hollie met online while playing a game and became a couple in Dubai. The British couple now lives in Wiltshire, England. A true car lover, Oliver owns three luxurious cars, namely, a ‘Tesla Model X,’ a ‘BMW i8,’ and a ‘Hummer H2.’</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-39346 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Oliver-Ryan-fam.jpg alt="Oliver Ryan" width=650 height=648 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-39346 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Oliver Ryan clicking a photo with his own family.
