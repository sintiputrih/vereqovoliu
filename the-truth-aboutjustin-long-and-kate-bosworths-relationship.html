But one of them stood out — Barbarian star Justin Long and Blue Crush alum Kate Bosworth who sparked engagement rumors after the latter was spotted with a big rock on her left ring finger. Here's a closer look at their relationship, as well as <a href=#>their famous exes</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Eminem Skipped Out On His 2003 Oscar Win And Regretted It Afterwards</a></span></p><h2 id=who-are-justin-long-39-s-famous-exes>Who Are Justin Long's Famous Exes?</h2><p>Long has had several <a href=#>celebrity exes like Amanda Seyfried</a>. But to this day, his most notable one is Drew Barrymore. The two dated from 2007 to 2010. In 2022, they had a reunion in The Drew Barrymore Show where the latter described their romance as "hedonistic."</p><p>"We had so much fun, but we were more hedonistic, more immature," shared the host. "We would get together, we would break up. There was chaos. It was hella fun." The Jeepers Creepers actor added, "Fun chaos. Well, yeah, most hedonism is fun," causing the pair to laugh. But all jokes aside, the two confessed that they "will always love" each other.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/instar48701566.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I will always love you so much. You were so important to me…I feel like we've been through so much together," said the Scream star while holding back her tears. "When we used to talk and FaceTime, I was always like, 'You know, I've really grown up, Justin.' I always wanted to prove to you what a different person I was than when we dated."</p><p>Long also expressed his love for Barrymore, calling her "the best" and telling her:</p><p>"I love that we've maintained our love because I know from my end it will never go anywhere. I'll love you always. I am glad that we are able to still have that. I mean that. I'll always love you."</p><p>Ahead of their reunion, the Wedding Singer actress also opened up about her ex during a behind-the-scenes segment of the show. "We dated for many years. I was very much in love with Justin. You know why? Because he's funny," she said of him.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"The sharpest wit. You want to know why he gets all the ladies? Well, there's a few reasons, but the comedy is definitely [one of them]. He is one of the sharpest, wittiest [people]. He's brilliant, and he'll just knock your socks off with laughter."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>What Brendan Fraser Has Planned After His Oscar-Winning Role In The Whale</a></span></p><h2 id=who-are-kate-bosworth-39-s-famous-exes>Who Are Kate Bosworth's Famous Exes?</h2><p>It was a big deal for Bosworth's career when <a href=#>she dated Orlando Bloom</a> from 2002 to 2006. They were rising stars at that time — the former for her breakout role in the "subtly feminist" Blue Crush and the latter for starring in the first Lord of the Rings movie.</p><p>The pair met during a Gap commercial in 2002. "I knew Orlando before he was famous at all," Bosworth later said on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen. "So we started dating way, way back in the day. And then it hit when we were together.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/instar49250359.jpg><p>Like many Hollywood couples, they tried to keep their relationship lowkey. But it was impossible since Bosworth was an "It girl" and Bloom was a "total heartthrob," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">per InStyle</a>. Being high-demand may have even led to their breakup. "They did decide to take some time apart due to their upcoming work schedule, and they remain very close. It was a mutual decision," a rep for the couple said at that time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After a few years, Bosworth revealed to Vogue that Bloom was her "first big heartbreak." She shared: "Orlando and I met when we were kids. Blue Crush hadn't come out. Lord of the Rings hadn't come out. He was the first big heartbreak. First love — you feel like it's the be-all and end-all. To put as little pressure on the relationship you're in is very important. I regret that it was too intense for both of us."</p><p>In 2011, Bosworth started dating director Michael Polish whom she'd worked with on the film, Big Sur that year. In August 2013 — after a year of being engaged — the two tied the knot in Philipsburg, Montana. In 2021, the actress announced that they had separated. They just finalized their divorce on March 15, 2023.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Sharon Stone Attended Her First Oscars In 1992 And Revealed Nobody Wanted To Dress Her</a></span></p><h2 id=are-justin-long-and-kate-bosworth-engaged>Are Justin Long And Kate Bosworth Engaged?</h2><p>Following their appearance at Vanity Fair's Oscars after-party, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a source confirmed to Entertainment Tonight</a> that the couple is now engaged. "They are both thrilled, and their loved ones are incredibly happy for them," the insider told the outlet. "They make an amazing couple, and they're so excited."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The two were first rumored to be dating back in 2021 when Bosworth posted an Instagram tribute to Long. Shortly after that, the latter said on his podcast, Life is Short with Justin Long that he had a girlfriend. He didn't disclose her name at that time.</p><h2><img alt="Are Justin Long and Kate Bosworth engaged?" height=4697 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/instar52523511.jpg width=3533 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></h2><p>Two months later, Long made their relationship Instagram official in a series of photos alongside Bosworth at a pub in Ireland. "I'm the luckiest. 🍀✨😘," she commented. On his 44th birthday in 2022, the 21 star thanked her beau for making her "smile so big my face hurts" and for "creating peace in my heart since the day we met."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroZ1dqb%2B2wMdmmJunpam3tr%2FToqVmpJ%2BjtG6tzZ1kpJmkmnqju9KwpqusmKh6s7HLmquip56otaq8jg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./1198023-beth-phoenix-most-memorable-crowd-reaction.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Beth Phoenix Recalls Her Most Memorable Crowd Reaction">&larr;
