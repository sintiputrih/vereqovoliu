Their union went on to last for six years before they went their separate ways in 1998. The duo later secured a civil divorce in 2002 but has never been divorced by the church because of personal reasons.</p><h3><strong>Summary of América Guinart’s Biography</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Full Name:</strong> América Guinart</li><li><strong>Gender:</strong> Female</li><li><strong>Ethnicity:</strong> Latino</li><li><strong>Zodiac Sign:</strong> Capricon</li><li><strong>Sexual Orientation:</strong> Straight</li><li><strong>Religion:</strong> Christianity</li><li><strong>Marital Status:</strong> Divorced</li><li><strong>América Guinart’s Ex-Husband:</strong> Alejandro Fernandez Abarca</li><li><strong>América Guinart’s Children:</strong> Alex, Camila, and América Fernandez</li><li><strong>Famous For:</strong> Being the wife of Alejandro Fernandez Abarca</li><li><strong>América Guinart’s Instagram:</strong> @meraguin</li></ul><h2><strong>What is América Guinart’s Ethnicity?</strong></h2><p>There is a dearth of information on América Guinart’s early life and family background, but she is undoubtedly Latino by ethnicity, just like her ex-husband, Alejandro Fernandez Abarca. The only info available on América’s parents is that both her mother and father were very close friends with Vicente Fernández, “El Ídolo de México,” Alejandro’s father.</p><p>Their friendship was a long-standing one as they already knew one another even before América came into this world. Alejandro’s former spouse was also very close to the “El Ídolo de México” and was devastated when he passed on. Other information like América’s siblings, growing up years, and academic institutions attended have never surfaced on the internet space to date.</p><h3><strong>She Celebrated Her Fiftieth Birthday With A Big Bash</strong></h3><p>While América Guinart’s date of birth is unknown, the ex-wife of Alejandro Fernandez turned 50 on the 22nd of December 2021. America’s fiftieth birthday was a huge celebration for her three children, who decided to hold a family reunion in honor of their mother.</p><p>Alex Fernández, his heavily pregnant wife, Alexia, and his sisters, Camila and América Fernández (named after her mother), were present at the reunion and later shared loads of family moments via their socials. Guinart’s granddaughter, Cayetana, was also represented at the family party.</p><h2><strong>How Old was América Guinart When She Met Alejandro Fernandez?</strong></h2><p>América Guinart was just an adolescent of 14 when her great love story with Alejandro Fernández started. According to the mother of three, they commenced dating immediately, and she was barely 21 in 1992 when they decided to take their relationship to the next level.</p><p>The details of their 1992 wedding ceremony were never communicated to the public, but America let on how she believed their union was meant to last forever by the time she clocked 22 the following year.</p><p>However, she was just a young lady seeing the world through a pair of rose-colored spectacles.&nbsp;Reality began to mesh with fantasy six years late when their union started experiencing cracks that widened into big marital issues, and by 1998, the couple’s union was done and dusted.</p><h3><strong>Did América Guinart Annul Her Marriage to Alejandro Fernandez?</strong></h3><p>No, the former lovebirds never deemed it necessary to annul their marriage; they told the religious media, AleteiaAmerica, that they had no plans to divorce by the church. América herself came out in the open to speak on the reasons they refused to annul their union by the church despite staying apart for over two decades.</p><p>According to her, they only went to court to get divorced because her husband was unrepentantly unfaithful, and she wasn’t willing to sweep that under the carpet. They later decided not to divorce by the church.</p><h3><strong>Why Did She Not Annul Their Marriage?</strong></h3><p>Immediately after they got separated, América Guinart went to meet Father Ángel Espinosa de los Monteros for his counsel and was made to understand that any marriage done in the church should last forever. It was thanks to the reverend father’s advice that they decided to end things with just a civil divorce.</p><p>America also recounted how she was treated by religious people after the end of her marriage to El Potrillo. Many wanted her ex-communicated from the church, and she was told to stop taking holy communion. In fact, she could no longer approach the church the way she used to. America has since confessed that she bears her ex no resentment despite all she went through in the marriage.</p><p>The mother of two said she has found her peace and wishes Alejandro to find peace too. Though America was the wronged part, she has maintained a very close relationship with her ex-husband’s family. Her reason for maintaining closeness with the family is because of her children, she said.</p><h3><strong>The Couple Finalized Their Divorce in 2002</strong></h3><p>The two later finalized their divorce in 2002 through the registry. With that said, fans and the general public have long concluded that the only connection between the exes was just their children until it came to light that they were never divorced by the church.</p><p>Despite their separation and divorce, América Guinart has her ex-husband at heart. According to the mother of three, she wishes for the father of her children to fall in love again and be happy. The woman he will eventually hook up with, she said, will also contribute good things to her children as well.</p><h2><strong>América Guinart’s Children</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2022/08/3QHBKKNIPRGJZAAGTZFO3JZFOY-e1661096541752.jpg><p>América Guinart and Alejandro Fernández’s marriage was blessed with three children – a son and twin daughters. The date of birth for Alex Fernández is unknown, but the son of América and Alejandro followed in his father and grandfather’s footsteps in the music industry.</p><p>His music career took off with a lot of support from his grandfather, Vicente Fernández “El Ídolo de México.” Alex is already married, and his wife, Alexia, recently gave birth to a baby.</p><p>Alex is a brother to twin girls Camila and América Fernández, who joined the family in 1997, just before their parent’s marriage hit the rocks. Camila has also followed in the family tradition as she launched her singing career. She is already married and is the mother of a cute baby girl who goes by the name, Cayetana.</p><p>When they were younger, Camilla and América confided in their mum that they would never get married in their lives because of their parent’s experience. However, América was able to annul their fears by assuring the twins that their father’s history wouldn’t repeat in their lives.</p><h3><strong>Guinart’s Profession is Unknown</strong></h3><p>Guinart’s profession has never been revealed to the public, which has led many to believe that she never had any. The ex-wife of Alejandro stayed back at home to take care of the family while her husband went to work.</p><h2><strong>Where Is Alejandro Fernández’s Ex-wife Now?</strong></h2><p>Since she left her marriage, América Guinart’s life revolves around her three children. She was the one who raised them after their divorce and is enjoying the pecks of a grandma now that they are married and settled. She always travels from one of her children’s homes to the other to spend quality time with them.</p><p>América loves visiting her children, but that is not her only preoccupation. Alejandro’s former wife found love again. Her current boyfriend is said to be a Mexican financial manager, but his name is unknown. According to Guinart, her former husband unfollowed her on social media after she shared her boyfriend’s photo on his birthday. This, she said, has continued to puzzle her.</p><h2><strong>Key Facts About Alejandro Fernández’s Ex-wife, América Guinart</strong></h2><p><strong>1.
