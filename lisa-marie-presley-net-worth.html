Her career in music has been active since the mid-1980s.</p><p>How rich is Lisa Marie Presley? According to sources, Lisa Marie Presley’s net worth is estimated to be an impressive $300 million. The main source for Lisa Marie’s wealth undoubtedly comes from her singing career, however, following the death of her father and her grandparents, at the age of 25 she became the sole inheritor of&nbsp; the estate of Graceland, Tennessee that is now worth approximately $100 million.</p><h3>Lisa Marie Presley Net Worth $300 Million</h3><p>Lisa Marie Presley made her debut in the music industry in 2003, when she released her debut album entitled “To Whom It May Concern” that peaked at #5 on the Billboard 200 chart and was certified gold by RIAA. The album produced several singles, one of which called “Lights Out” peaked at #18 on the Billboard chart. For the song “Savior” featured on the B-side of the album, Presley collaborated with the lead singer of the band “Smashing Pumpkins” <a href=#>Billy Corgan</a>. Two years later, in 2005, Lisa Marie Presley released her second studio album, entitled “Now What”. The album managed to reach #9 on the Billboard 200 chart and produced two singles: “Dirty Laundry” and “Idiot”. Presley’s third and so far the most recent album was released in 2012 under the name of “Storm & Grace”, which is considered to be Presley’s strongest album to date.</p><p>In addition to working on her albums, Lisa Marie Presley has not shied away from collaborating with several artists and making contributions to songs and videos. Some of the people Presley has worked with include <a href=#>T-Bone Burnett</a>, Richard Hawley, <a href=#>Kylie Minogue</a> and the band Coldplay. Presley’s constant presence in the music industry is one of the key sources for her remarkable $300 million net worth. Presley’s most successful project came in 2007 when she released the single entitled “In The Ghetto” on which she “duets” with her legendary father. The single became an instant success, reaching #1 on iTunes, and peaking at #16 on Billboard’s Bubbling Under Hot 100 singles chart.</p><p>To commemorate her father <a href=#>Elvis Presley</a>, Lisa Marie hosted an exhibition entitled “Elvis… Through His Daughter’s Eyes” that consisted of a collection of 200 items that Lisa Marie has collected during her life. All of these items were related to the King of Rock and Roll.</p><p>Lisa Marie Presley has been actively participating in charity events. In 1997, Lisa Marie co-founded a Literacy, Education and Ability Program (LEAP) that provides free educational services. She also continues the tradition of the <a href=#>Elvis Presley</a> Charitable Foundation and in 2011 was named a patron of a charity called “Dream Factory”.</p><p>Lisa Marie Presley has married four times. She was married to musician Danny Keough(1988- 94); they have two children. Lisa Marie then married music star <a href=#>Michael Jackson</a>, partly because she says that he needed constant close support, but they divorced two years later. Lisa Marie was married to actor <a href=#>Nicolas Cage</a> from 2002 to 2004, although they apparently separated after 100 days. Lisa Marie currently resides in East Sussex, England with her fourth husband, her music producer Michael Lockwood; they have twin daughters.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=21.781526104418><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Lisa Marie Presley</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$300 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>February 1, 1968</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Memphis, Tennessee, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>5 ft 2 in (1.6 m)</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Singer-songwriter</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr readability=7><td>Spouse</td><td>Michael Lockwood (m. 2006-2016, filed for divorce), Danny Keough (1988-1994), Michael Jackson (1994-1996), Nicolas Cage (m. 2002–2004)</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Children</td><td>Riley Keough, Benjamin Keough, Finley Aaron Love Lockwood, Harper Vivienne Ann Lockwood</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Parents</td><td>Priscilla Presley, Elvis Presley</td></tr><tr><td>Siblings</td><td>Navarone Garibaldi</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Nicknames</td><td>Lisa Presley , Lisa Marie Presley-Jackson , LMP , LMFP</td></tr><tr readability=0.33333333333333><td>Facebook</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.facebook.com/lisamariepresley</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.34146341463415><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.twitter.com/lisapresley</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.30434782608696><td>MySpace</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.myspace.com/lisamariepresley</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.21052631578947><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1070086</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.25396825396825><td>Allmusic</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>www.allmusic.com/artist/lisa-marie-presley-mn0000246094</a></td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Awards</td><td>American Society of Young Musician Favorite New Female Rock Vocalis (2005), Humanitarian Award from the World Literacy Crusade (2002)</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Albums</td><td>”Now What” (2005), ”To Whom It May Concern” (2003), ”Storm & Grace” (2012)</td></tr><tr readability=10><td>TV Shows</td><td>The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, American Idol (2012), Elvis by the Presleys (2005, documentary), Michael Jackson: HIStory on Film - Volume II (1997), The 2012 Billboard Music Awards (2012), The Oprah Winfrey Show</td></tr></table><table class=quotes readability=19.521690767519><tr><th>#</th><th>Quote</th></tr><tr readability=6.7092651757188><td>1</td><td>[on films made about her father <a href=#>Elvis Presley</a>] There can be a sort of cheesy take on him, which I don't always love sometimes - you know, the later years and that whole thing with his white jumpsuit.
