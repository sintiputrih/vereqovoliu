Following that, he was featured in a Bruce Weber photo session for Abercrombie & Fitch. Haynes then started modeling for Kira Plastinina, J. C. Penney, and Ralph Lauren. Haynes resumed modeling in 2008, appearing in ads such as Verizon as well as various magazine editorials such as Teen Vogue and Arena. In 2011, Haynes walked the red carpet.</p><p>He appeared uncredited in the 2007 movie Transformers. He was also seen in CSI: Miami and The Hills. In addition to cameo appearances, Haynes appeared in My Chemical Romance’s music video for “I Don’t Love You,” directed by Marc Webb, in April 2007. Haynes auditioned for the part of Edward Cullen in the film adaptation of Stephenie Meyer’s young adult book Twilight later that year, but Robert Pattinson was selected instead. He had appearances on the television shows Privileged and Pushing Daisies in 2008.</p><p>In the Hallmark Channel film Always and Forever, he portrayed Scott Holland. Filming started in December 2008, and the film was shown on October 24, 2009. Haynes got the part of Shane in the Showtime series Look, based on the 2007 film of the same name, in 2009. “I portray a 17-year-old jerk. The program is very provocative, with plenty of nudity, sex, drugs, and real-life situations that will astound viewers “In an interview, Haynes said. The program debuted in 2010 and was canceled after one season. Haynes started production for the ABC television series The Gates in March 2010, in which he plays Brett Crezski, a jock who starts to transform into a werewolf. The show debuted on June 20, 2010. After its first season, the program was canceled.</p><h2>Colton Haynes Wife & Marriage</h2><p><strong>Colton Haynes</strong> has battled anxiety his whole life. After years of public conjecture about his “hidden homosexual background,” an off-the-cuff reaction he made on Tumblr about a comment on images published in gay lifestyle magazine XY a decade ago was interpreted as evidence of his coming out by numerous media sources in January 2016. Haynes sought therapy for his anxieties over the following three months because he was not yet ready to talk freely about his sexual orientation. In May 2016, he came out as homosexual in an interview with Entertainment Weekly. Haynes said that he kept his sexuality hidden because he was persuaded by experts in the entertainment world that being upfront about it would harm his career.</p><p>On March 11, 2017, Haynes and renowned florist Jeff Leatham got engaged. On October 27, 2017, they married. Haynes filed for divorce from Leatham in May 2018, but the couple reunited before their first wedding anniversary. They did, however, finalize a divorce settlement in August 2019.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiaqKSkpLtutMCypZ6rXw%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./erich-gonzales-wiki-height-net-worth-husband-marriage.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Erich Gonzales- Wiki, Height, Net Worth, Husband, Marriage">&larr;
