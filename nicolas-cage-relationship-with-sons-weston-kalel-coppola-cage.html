Though Nicolas has had multiple marriages, culminating in his fifth marriage to Riko Shibata in 2021 (though <a href=# rel=nofollow>he nearly annulled that marriage a few days in</a>), it seems like he's always been consistently involved with his sons.</p><p>Weston Coppola Cage, 32, and Kal-El Coppola Cage, 18, both from previous relationships.</p><h2 id=who-is-nicolas-cage-39-s-son-weston-coppola-cage>Who Is Nicolas Cage's Son, Weston Coppola Cage?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/weston-coppola-cage-alice-cage-nicolas-cage.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Weston has been in two metal bands — he was the lead singer of Eyes of Noctum and the founder of Arsh Anubis. Weston also had an appearance in Cage's movie, Lord of War. He played a helicopter mechanic.</p><p>Weston didn't pursue acting but he still followed in the Oscar-winning actor's footsteps... at least in terms of marriage. The rocker has been married three times — for only two years with his first wife Nikki Williams, and three years with the second one, Danielle, with whom he shares two sons.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow title="Nicolas Cage Made $40 Million In 2009 Alone, So How Is The Actor Left With $25 Million Today?">Nicolas Cage Made $40 Million In 2009 Alone, So How Is The Actor Left With $25 Million Today?</a></span></p><p>Weston has been married to his third wife, Hila Cage Coppola, since 2018, and the pair share two children.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Weston's mother has repeatedly expressed her concerns about his "troubled" life. After a scary event in 2011, after which Weston was hospitalized, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she said in an interview,</a> "I need to just go get my son. I am the one that raised Weston.

His father almost played the DC superhero in <a href=# rel=nofollow>Tim Burton's cancelled Superman movie</a>. Interestingly, Kal-El's first acting gig was as a voice actor for the young Bruce Wayne in the 2018 movie, Teen Titans GO! To the Movies.

Cage met Kim in 2004 when she was only 19 years old. She was working as a waitress at Kabuki restaurant in Los Angeles. Before falling off the radar to live a private life, she had some acting stints in the movies Next, Werewolf When of the S.S., and Grindhouse. Nicolas and Alice divorced in 2018.</p><h2 id=what-is-nicolas-cage-39-s-relationship-with-his-sons-like>What Is Nicolas Cage's Relationship With His Sons Like?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/lisa-marie-nicolas-cage.jpg><p>Cage seems to have a close relationship with both of his sons, as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he's been photographed with them in public several times</a> Despite Fulton's claims that Nicolas has "damaged" their son's life, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Weston actually filed a restraining order against his mother in 2020</a>. She was allegedly abusive towards him and his family. Stalking, theft, blackmail, and possession of firearms were among the accusations made by the Ghost Rider star's eldest son.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The court eventually dismissed the restraining order complaint. Fulton's lawyer said there was "an extensive amount of evidence to refute all the outrageous unfounded accusations." The former actress added that she was "hurt and shocked" because she's always "championed" his son who she claims to have "an ongoing issue with mental illness, substance, and alcohol abuse."</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/nic-cage-in-captain-corelli-1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Nicolas Cage And Penélope Cruz Had Completely Opposite Experiences Filming Captain Corelli's Mandolin</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Nicola Cage's divorce made for a terrible time on set while making a box office bomb.</span><p>Meanwhile, Cage appears to have a "normal" father-son relationship with his youngest son, Kal-El. The actor has remained good friends with his ex-wife over the years, so they've maintained a healthy co-parenting relationship. They've been spotted shopping and having dinner together with their son several times.</p><p>Kim was also reportedly present at Cage's 2021 wedding to Shibata.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I don't really count those two marriages, I don't think they belong on my record," said the actor of his previous marriages before starting his family with Kim—including <a href=# rel=nofollow>his marriage to Lisa Marie Presley</a>.</p><p>"The real marriage for me was the 14 years I had with Alice and the child we have together.''</p><p>While Nicolas may have two sons, he also has a new daughter. In 2022, Nicolas Cage welcomed his first daughter—named August—with his wife Riko Shibata. Nic announced his baby daughter's impending arrival on The Kelly Clarkson Show, saying "I'm gonna announce some big news for everyone. I am gonna have a little girl.</p><p>Viewers can catch the announcement at the 30-second mark.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>By all accounts, Cage loved being a dad to his young sons, and says he's "looking forward to getting back to that."</p><p>People quoted Nic as saying, "My boys are all grown up, and I miss going to the toy store. I miss singing lullabies and rocking in the rocking chair."</p><p>There's no word yet, however, on whether Nicolas plans to have more children, whether with his current wife or a future one.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGilopufoa60ecKanp5lopq5osDIqKWsoJmleri106FkrKeeqHq4sdKtpqdlm5a5priMnKapqJ%2Bhrm6vwKCcaA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./israel-gutierrez.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Israel Gutierrez Biography, Age, Height, Wife, Net Worth, Family">&larr;
