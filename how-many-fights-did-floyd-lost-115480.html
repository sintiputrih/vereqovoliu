But has Money ever lost a fight?</p><p>Many fans and ringside observers believe that Floyd Mayweather lost to Jose Luis Castillo in their first fight. Floyd Mayweather later rematched Castillo and beat him more decisively. As a professional boxer, Floyd Mayweather remains undefeated.</p><p>Floyd Mayweather retired as an undefeated professional boxer after defeating Conor McGregor in a crossover boxing match in 2017. 50 opponents, including the likes of Oscar De La Hoya, Saul ‘Canelo’ Alvarez and Manny Pacquiao could not get their hands raised when they fought ‘Money’.</p><p>Following the fight Mayweather had shoulder surgery and was completely healed when the two met for a rematch in December. The scorecard was actually closer in the rematch, but Mayweather won in an unanimous decision.</p><h2>How many fights has Floyd Mayweather won?</h2><p>Floyd Mayweather has been at the top of the boxing world since the 1990’s, winning each of his<strong> 50</strong> professional bouts. But has Money ever lost a fight?</p><p>Childhood friend<strong> Augie Sanchez</strong> one of few to beat Mayweather. Sanchez won the first of three qualifying bouts in a tight 11-12 decision. Mayweather got redemption in the final two fights of the best-of-three format and earned his spot in the Summer Games that year.</p><p>He went on to win bronze after the semifinal defeat, and later that year turned professional. Mayweather’s first professional bout came in<strong> October 1996.</strong> A second round knockout of Roberto Apodaca started a historic victory streak for Floyd which carries on to this day.</p><p>The 18 year old amateur reached the 125 pound semi-final fight. His opponent was<strong> Serafim Todorov</strong> from Bulgaria. The bout went to decision, and the referee lifted Mayweather’s hand before realizing the judges had sided with the Bulgarian.</p><p>We all know of Floyd Mayweather’s incredible record as a professional boxer. If you didn’t know, just listen to an interview of his or ask him yourself, and he won’t hesitate to tell you all about his undefeated record. But he may not be as eager to bring up with t he handful of defeats he suffered before turning pro.</p><h2>How many fights did Floyd Mayweather win?</h2><p>He was just good enough to win and, in the end, that’s all that matters. Of his<strong> 50</strong> fights, his opponent took him the distance 23 times or just under half the time he stepped into the ring.</p><p>Within the boxing community, however, many believe Floyd Mayweather ‘s record should actually be<strong> 49-1.</strong> There is dispute about one particular fight where Mayweather was outclassed most of the contest and behind statistically, but judges still awarded him the victory. Here’s a look back at the controversial fight.</p><p><strong>De La Hoya</strong> wasn’t the only fighter that put Mayweather to the test.<strong> Canelo Alvarez</strong> and<strong> Marcos Maidana</strong> both pushed Mayweather the distance only to lose by majority decision. In the case of Maidana, Mayweather knew it was a close fight and offered a rematch five months later where Mayweather won in a much more convincing fashion.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>On April 20, 2002, Floyd Mayweather faced<strong> Jose Luis Castillo</strong> at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas fighting for Castillo’s WBC lightweight title and the vacant The Ring lightweight title.</p><p>On October 21, 2000, Mayweather fought The Drunken Master, aka Emanuel Augustus. Augustus was known for his unorthodox style, which included a wild array of dipping shoulders, raised legs, and punch sequences, unlike anything the sport had ever seen. He appeared to be part boxer, part string-puppet. His herky-jerky style earned him the funny nickname.</p><p>Lederman’s scorecard reflected that as he scored the fight 115-111 in favor of Castillo. The official judges scored the fight 115–111, 115-111, and 116–111, in favor of Mayweather as he improved to 28-0.</p><p>Mayweather said in the post-fight interview he had injured his shoulder on his last training day and was unable to use the jab effectively. It was clear that injury adversely affected his performance, and the stats proved it. CompuBox showed Castillo throwing and landing many more punches and power punches than Floyd. Lederman’s scorecard reflected that as he scored the fight 115-111 in favor of Castillo.</p><h2>How many wins did Floyd Mayweather have?</h2><p>His record is stellar: He has never lost a fight, posting<strong> 50</strong> wins, including 27 KOs, and no losses. Here’s a look at the Mayweather’s fight-by-fight career record as a professional.</p><p>The 1990s: Becomes Champ. After fighting as an amateur for a number of years, Mayweather turned pro in 1996 and took only two years to win his first title.</p><p>2011.<strong> Mayweather</strong> won the WBC welterweight title by knocking out Victor Ortiz in a September Las Vegas bout — in the fourth round no less. Sept. 17 – Victor Ortiz, Las Vegas, KO 4.</p><p>The boxer has<strong> never</strong> lost a fight as a pro. Andrew Eisele is a boxing writer who has covered the sport for Time, Inc. He also hosts TV and radio sports talk shows. Many consider Floyd Mayweather Jr., a professional boxer, to be one of the sport’s best defensive fighters.</p><p><h3 class=jp-relatedposts-headline>Related</h3></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivmaC2b6%2FEpZybqpmpxm%2ByzGifqK9doq6vxYyfoKCgpKh6pbXDZp2lp6mZeq270q1kamllaYVxew%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./kim-wayans-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-353045-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kim Wayans Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography">&larr;
