She also worked as an account executive at a marketing agency called Levelwing.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Southern Charm:</h2><p>In 2016, she made her debut on the reality television show Southern Charm, as the girlfriend of Craig Conover, one of the main cast members. The show follows the personal and professional lives of several socialites in Charleston, who belong to prominent families or have ties to the city’s history and culture. Naomie became a fan favorite for her outspokenness, honesty, and style. She also shared her struggles with anxiety and body image issues on the show.</p><p>She dated Craig for three years, but they broke up in 2017 due to their differences and lack of compatibility. She then started dating Metul Shah, an anesthesiologist, in 2018. They had a long-distance relationship for a while, as Metul moved to New York City for his fellowship. Naomie left the show in 2020 and moved to New York City with Metul.&nbsp;She said that she wanted to focus on her career and well-being, and that she had outgrown the drama of the show.&nbsp;However, they split up in 2021 after Naomie discovered that Metul had cheated on her.</p><p>Naomie returned to the show in 2021 as a guest for season 8.
