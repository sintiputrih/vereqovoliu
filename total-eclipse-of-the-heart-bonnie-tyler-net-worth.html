She topped the charts with hit after hit, including the 1983 single "Total Eclipse Of The Heart". It's a song that's sold over 6 million copies, and currently has over 900 million views on YouTube.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Other stars from her generation include David Bowie, Prince, and Michael Jackson. It's well known that those music stars <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">made massive fortunes</a>, which begs the question - how much has Bonnie made over the years? She has a catalog of recognizable hit singles, with chart-topping albums to match as well. Here's how much her music has made, and what she's done with her money.</p><h2 id=what-is-bonnie-tyler-famous-for><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>What Is Bonnie Tyler Famous For?</span></h2><p>Bonnie knew from a young age that she wanted to be a singer. Her mother sang opera a lot when Bonnie was younger, and Bonnie herself sang a lot when she attended church. Her biggest musical influences growing up, besides church-related music, were Elvis Presley and The Beatles. No surprise there, as most children her age were also <a href=#>influenced by those iconic musicians</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Much Is Elvis Presley's Estate Worth Today?</a></span></p><p>Her big hit song was "Holding Out For A Hero". It's a song that's been a mainstay on the radio and in movies/T.V. shows. However, what is little known to a lot of people is that she is responsible for another hit song from the same time period. That song is "Total Eclipse Of The Heart". Not many people actually know that Bonnie happens to sing both of those songs.</p><h2 id=what-is-bonnie-tyler-39-s-net-worth><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>What Is Bonnie Tyler's Net Worth?</span></h2><p>According to Celebrity Net Worth, Bonnie Tyler has a net worth of $30 million. That's a lot of money for a singer who isn't exactly the biggest household name. Here's how she got to accumulate that much money</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Part of her net worth comes from her songs appearances in movies. 'Shrek 2' featured 'Holding Out For A Hero', which has revitalized the song for a whole new generation of kids. The songs included in the Shrek films were so popular that they single-handedly <a href=#>turned the musicians involved into big names</a>, but none of the songs used have been as memorable as the film's use of Bonnie's song.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Mike Myers Said This About The Future Of “Shrek”</a></span></p><p>'Total Eclipse Of The Heart' has appeared in the 2001 kids' movie 'Bandit', and has made an appearance in a slew of other films as well. It's safe to say Bonnie's compensation for allowing her songs to be a part of these soundtracks is why she's as wealthy as she is.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On top of that, both of those songs alone have made her millions. She's been able to tour for decades now, with tours still going on to this day. Seeing as tours and festivals have become most musicians' biggest sources of revenue, it's wise to think her concerts have been a huge source of wealth.</p><h2 id=how-much-money-did-bonnie-tyler-make-from-quot-total-eclipse-of-the-heart-quot><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>How Much Money Did Bonnie Tyler Make From "Total Eclipse Of The Heart"?</span></h2><p>So how much money has "Total Eclipse Of The Heart" specifically made for Bonnie?</p><p>Considering that the song sold <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">over six million copies</a>, it's safe to say the hit song has made a lot of money for Bonnie. While songs don't make as much money for artists anymore, a song selling six million copies definitely adds up to a considerable bag.</p><p>There's also the royalty aspect of it all. Any movie that uses the song, or any musician that samples it, adds towards Bonnie's net worth.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-was-quot-total-eclipse-of-the-heart-quot-made><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>How Was "Total Eclipse Of The Heart" Made?</span></h2><p>The production and writing of a song has been studied like a science over the years. Back in earlier days of music, there was a lot of experimentation, and not much of a routine. However, considering that universities are now studying songwriting techniques from artists <a href=#>such as Taylor Swift</a>, curiosity remains for how songs such as 'Total Eclipse Of The Heart' are created.</p><p>According to People, Bonnie was so in love with singer Meat Loaf's music that she really wanted to work with his surrounding artists. She met Meat Loaf's producer Jim Steinman. They clashed a little bit, testing each other's abilities and interests. Eventually, they created the song after weeks of independent collaboration. The song wasn't complete yet, and had to be consciously shortened in order to become a radio hit.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-is-quot-total-eclipse-of-the-heart-quot-about><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>What Is "Total Eclipse Of The Heart" About?</span></h2><p>What is this song that's made Bonnie millions of dollars even about?</p><p>'Total Eclipse Of The Heart' is, as you may have guessed, a love song. Like Bonnie's other love songs, it's of the more epic nature. It's also sadder and somber, with the theme of the song revolving around loneliness. It's about a girl who's dying to embrace her lover, even though he is not there.</p><p>There are lyrics that play around with the eclipse part of the title. It makes sense why the song seems to chart when there are actual occurring eclipses.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-has-bonnie-tyler-bought-with-her-millions><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>What Has Bonnie Tyler Bought With Her Millions?</span></h2><p>So, Bonnie's made a massive fortune due to her music. What has the 70s star purchased with all of that money?</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Kate Bush's Lifestyle Got So Much More Luxurious Thanks To Her Net Worth Increase</a></span></p><p>Bonnie has been famous for the ownership of a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">massive estate in the United Kingdom</a>. The only other known major purchases include a mansion in Portugal and some homes in the United States. It's pretty interesting that she owns all of these homes, since she's actually married to a property developer.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirqKyRoXqmr8uip6ydXaSzbsDHnmShnZGnwW6uzqelop1dqcatsdFmpZ6sXay8s8DHaA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./adam-g-sevani-net-worth-2024-2.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Adam G Sevani Net Worth 2024">&larr;
