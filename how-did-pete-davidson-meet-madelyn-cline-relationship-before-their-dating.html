And these people that I've dated, I met them at work," he remarked about his famous partners. "I wasn't in anyone's DMs, no one was in mine. ...

In February 2023, she told Today, "Some people can discuss their personal life—I can't. If you give everything, like, 100 percent of your energy, away, where's the rest for yourself? You finally understand why people in the public eye keep their circles small."</p><p>She added, "I realized there are parts of my life that only me or one other person are entitled to. I prefer it that way. It also just makes things more special. That's usually how relationships are."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Has Chase Sui Wonders Completely Changed Her Life After Breaking Up With Pete Davidson?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The actress also confessed to Cosmopolitan Magazine that she is a very private person and that, in hindsight, she regretted making her relationship public because it made it everyone else's business. She realized the drawbacks of this decision during the breakup, feeling like she had allowed people in and couldn't keep them out, which hit her hard. Her ultimate goal was for both of them to move on and be happy, emphasizing that there shouldn't be any sides or a sense of winning or losing in a breakup.
