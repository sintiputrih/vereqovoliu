Questions of whether he currently has a girlfriend or someone to call his wife often arise.&nbsp;</p><p>All we can say is, he is a family guy and has a lot of love for his kids. He loves his daughter and often shares his journey with her on his social media.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Moreover, Brady is still friends with his ex-wife to co-parent.&nbsp;Here is everything about Brady's personal life and kids.&nbsp;</p><h2>Wayne Brady's Marriage</h2><p>Brady has been married twice. His first marriage was with&nbsp;Diana Lasso, which lasted approximately two years.&nbsp;</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>His second marriage was with a former dancer, Mandie Taketa.&nbsp;When The Masked Singer star and Taketa exchanged vows,&nbsp;the public had no idea that they would end their marriage with a divorce. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>While working in Hawaii, Brady&nbsp;met Taketa&nbsp;and tied the knot on April 5, 1999.&nbsp;They were married for exactly eight years before divorcing on April 5, 2006.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p><strong>Wayne Brady with ex-wife Mandie Taketa and daughter Maile posing for a picture.</strong> (Source: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>) <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>They cited&nbsp;irreconcilable differences as the grounds for divorce. But unlike most separations, Brady and Taketa remain great friends.&nbsp;</p><p>The&nbsp;Let's Make a Deal&nbsp;host <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">told People</a> that the split was amicable and they would remain "best of friends and committed parents."&nbsp;</p><h2>Wayne Brady's Daughter, Maile</h2><p>Brady has a daughter named Maile with Taketa.&nbsp;After their split, Taketa&nbsp;demanded&nbsp;joint legal and physical custody of Maile, which was granted to the couple.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>It is not uncommon for celebrities to claim to be friends after a breakup.&nbsp;However, the pair decided to live close to each other in an effort to co-parent Maile effectively.</p><p>In August 2021, Brady <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">uploaded a video</a> on his Instagram, where he talked about co-parenting with Taketa. He explained their daughter was starting college, and they dropped her off at her dorm.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>He admitted that co-parenting was difficult, and sometimes it was like "hell." He also confessed that he and Taketa fought a lot and did not want to talk to each other for days.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Regardless of the ups and downs, the two were proud to raise their kid. They appreciated and thanked each other for having one another's back and co-parenting in the best way they could.</p><p></p><p><strong>Wayne Brady with his daughter, Maile, on a Daytime Emmy's red carpet event.</strong>&nbsp;(Source: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>)</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>In June 2021, Taketa also uploaded a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">similar video</a> on her Instagram. It showed the journey of Maile from her preschool day to college.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>It is evident by Brady's and Taketa's social media that they love their child&nbsp;a lot. In November 2020, the comedian posted a video singing with Maile.&nbsp;</p><p>Via the captions, he <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">gushed</a> about how much he loved her. He said, "I cannot tell you the joy and pride that fills me when I'm in the presence of my daughter."</p><p>He further said that he was humbled that Maile chose him and Taketa as her parents.</p><h2>Does Wayne Brady Have Kids?</h2><p>Other than Maile, Brady does not have any biological kids. However, he considers Taketa's other family as his own, including her son.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p></p><p><strong>Wayne Brady poses for a picture with his extended family. </strong>(Source: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>) <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-175 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Taketa is in a relationship with Jason Fordham, and the couple is on good terms with Brady. The comedian considers Fordham a member of his family and even lives next door to each other.&nbsp;</p><p>The Whose Line Is It Anyway? cast member made headlines last year when he revealed that Taketa,&nbsp;Maile, Fordham were quarantining together. He later explained to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">People</a> that they were not living under the same roof.&nbsp;</p><p>Rather, they were neighbors and were limiting themselves to just two homes in the COVID-19 pandemic. In September 2021, Taketa took to Instagram <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">to explain</a>&nbsp;that she and her partner were adopting. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-176 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>They welcomed Ana&nbsp;and her son, Sundance-Isamu, aka Sunny, into their blended family. Taketa then revealed that Brady was Sunny's godfather, who was going to spoil his godson "like crazy."</p><p>In September 2021, Brady uploaded a video on his <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a> where he introduced Taketa's son, Sunny, to the world.</p><p>He claimed he loved Sunny already, and he was helping his ex-wife and Fordham raise Sunny. He dubbed himself "Duncle" and said he was honored to be in Sunny's life.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Similarly, he thanked Taketa and Fordham for including him in their journey.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaK%2BRrrumecGrmJ2xXZmutrPHrZyrZpipuq0%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./what-is-patrick-mahomes-rookie-card-worth-in-2024.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What is Patrick Mahomes' Rookie Card Worth in 2024?">&larr;
