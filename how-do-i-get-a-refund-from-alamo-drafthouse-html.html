As a Victory member who bought a ticket via drafthouse.com or the Alamo Drafthouse mobile app, you have the option to seek a refund of your ticket, less the online booking charge, using the mobile app.</p><p></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3>So, how can I request a refund from Fandango in light of this?</h3><p>Is it possible to swap or obtain a refund for your whole purchase, less a convenience charge, via Fandango up to the time of the scheduled show? In certain restricted situations, yes. Before the scheduled showtime, you’ll need to complete your refund and exchange requests. Please visit our Fandango Ticket Policy for a complete list of terms and limitations.</p><p></p><h3>In addition to the aforementioned, is it possible to conceal carry at Alamo Drafthouse?</h3><p>&nbsp;Open Carry is not permitted on our property*. Only concealed licenced handguns are permitted on our property*.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147 data-inserter-version=2></span><p></p><h3>Is it possible to get a refund for movie tickets purchased online in light of this?</h3><p>Refunds are available for tickets and food and beverage items bought via our website or mobile app up to one hour before the scheduled performance time. You may request a refund online, via the Tickets section of your AMC Stubs account, or through the confirmation email that you received after purchasing your tickets. Convenience fees are not refundable under any circumstances.</p><p></p><h3>Is there a student discount available at Alamo Drafthouse?</h3><p>College students and visitors with disabilities will get a $1 discount off the regular ticket price for all events (excluding the Late Night discounted ticket).
