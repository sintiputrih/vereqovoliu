The actress is also married to her husband and the book she wrote was filled with things she went through before tying the knot.</p><p>Born on 15 March 1983, in Dallas, Texas, Jaime grew up watching comedy and during her formative years she was influenced by <strong>David Cross</strong>, <strong>Ellen</strong> and many others. The idea of doing comedy for a career was something she took to heart and after graduating from the University of Texas, she started her standup career, while also developing her writing on the side.</p><p>After some small jobs here and there Jaime took to stage, trying to cut her teeth in comedy. Slowly she was making headway with placements in Conan and assisting big names in comedy. And it was not long before she was hired as a writer.

With a long standing career of his own in the show business the couple were perfect for each other. In the early days the duo featured heavily on each other's Instagram grids. The lovebirds were vacationing together and looked all kinds of loved up in pictures and videos.</p><p>But you cannot remain boyfriend and girlfriend forever, there needs to be a sense of progression for any relationship to survive.
