He is also a proud father of a boy publicly known as King Conde, the product of his relationship with Erica Mena.&nbsp;</p><p>Aside from his rich hip-hop history, Raul Conde was also popular among netizens because of his link to Erica Mena, an American television personality and former model and video vixen.&nbsp;</p><p>Many things happened between Conde and his baby mama. They made headlines many times for their drama before they eventually parted ways. Keep reading to learn more about who Raul Conde is and what happened between him and Mena.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/raulll.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_King_Condes_Father></span>Who Is King Conde’s Father?&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>King Conde’s father is Raul Conde. Conde is an American rapper, actor, and music video director.&nbsp;He is best known for being a member of the hip-hop record label Terror Squad, which was put together by his friend, Fat Joe, in 1998 in The Bronx (New York). He is also known as a talented video director.&nbsp;</p><p>Conde directed the 2004 song “Lean Back” for the album True Story. The track won a Grammy nomination for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group. It also got nominated for a BET Award for Viewer’s Choice.</p><p>Raul Conde is a talented man, no doubt. However, his musical career is not the only reason he gets featured in headlines. In 2011, he was involved in a controversy with his former girlfriend, Erica Mena, that escalated to the point of her assaulting him on the streets.&nbsp;</p><p>Mena had accused him of abusive behavior in the past and would eventually end the relationship even though it meant making parenting their only child more difficult.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_Happened_Between_Raul_Conde_and_Erica_Mena></span>What Happened Between Raul Conde and Erica Mena?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Their relationship became more intense after Mena got pregnant with their first child, King Conde, at age 19. But she quickly learned he was not the best parent or lover then.&nbsp;</p><p>Mena was very vocal about it. She would call him out for being a terrible father and partner in interviews, but it was worse. He was also abusive, and violence plagued their relationship.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/mena-fotor-20231107114440.jpg><p>Conde reportedly abused her excessively while their on-again-off-again relationship played out. Fans of the famous TV personality saw first-hand how turbulent the bond between her and Conde was when their love life was showcased in one of the episodes of “Love and Hip Hop: New York.”&nbsp;</p><p>The episode about Conde and Mena captured a fierce argument between them on the streets of Miami, and she was even seen getting physical with him. Later, Mena apologized for her actions, feeling ashamed of her outburst and how it could affect their child.</p><p>She ultimately chose to end the relationship, after which she moved on with rapper Bow Wow. More recently, reports claim that Mena and her baby daddy have gotten past their differences and are trying to stay cordial for the sake of their child.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Erica-Menas-ex-partner-600x400-1.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_Much_Is_Raul_Conde_Worth></span>How Much Is Raul Conde Worth?&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Conde has made some very crucial contributions to the rise of the hip-hop label, and this has left him a wealthy man. He is not only known as a member of the Terror Squad hip-hop label in the United States but also has collaborations with several well-known artists, including Fat Joe, Remy Martin, Big Pun, Dr. Dre, Armageddon, and Buju Banton.</p><p>Aside from collaborations, he is also a music director with many credits. He even has his studio, where he teams up with his clients to create new hip-hop songs. Outside music, he is endorsed by a Tequila brand called Tequila Penacho Azteca, supported by other artists like Lil Wayne, Fat Joe, DJ Khaled, Timbaland, etc.</p><p>Raul Conde has also been <a href=#>featured </a>in documentaries like “Unsung” and “Inside the Label.” With all he has going for himself, there is no doubt Conde has earned millions so far. However, the private man has not publicly declared the extent of his wealth.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_Many_Kids_Does_Raul_Conde_Have></span>How Many Kids Does Raul Conde Have?&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Conde and Mena’s relationship was not scheduled for longevity, and it was only <a href=#>blessed </a>with one child, whom they named King Javien Conde, aka King Conde.&nbsp;Raul Conde’s son, <a href=#>King</a>, entered this world on March 1, 2007.</p><p>Almost five years before the former couple broke up in 2011. Since their split, the rapper has become more private with his love life and welcomed more kids.&nbsp;According to his Instagram page, he has three kids he once called his heart and soul. The names of his other kids include Josh Conde and Ali Conde.</p><p>Unfortunately, it is unknown if both kids share the same mother or if he welcomed them with different women. The rapper has been very closemouthed about his partners, so whom he shares his other two kids with is unknown.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kv6LBy2aaqKaUmnq4tM5moKxlm567qHnCqKWdnaNis6LAx56paA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./martin-fennelly-obituary.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Sad Announcement!
